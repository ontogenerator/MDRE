	abstract = {During summer 1986, we assessed the effect of individual variation in per flower nectar production rate on one component of plant reproductive success (percent fruit set) mediated through differential pollinator attractiveness. Thirty-two individual mountain laurels, Kalmia latifolia, were monitored for average 24-h nectar production in individual flowers, average per flower pollinator visitation rate, average floral density, and percent fruit set. Significant positive correlations occurred between (1) average 24-h nectar production by individual flowers and average visitation rate per flower, and (2) average visitation rate per flower and percent fruit set. Pollinators appeared to be differentially attracted to individual shrubs that produce larger quantities of nectar per flower, and the increase visitation rate promoted a higher percentage fruit set because K. latifolia is pollination limited. However, there was no correlation between an individual shrub's 24-h nectar production in 1986 and the same individual's 24-h nectar production in 1985. Thus, while pollinator behavior appears to influence this component of plant reproductive success in Kalmia, any selective advantage to individuals may vary between flowering seasons.},

	abstract = {Consistent with human gambling behaviour but contrary to optimal foraging theory, pigeons showed maladaptive choice behaviour in experiment 1 by choosing an alternative that provided on average two food pellets over an alternative that provided a certain three food pellets. On 20 per cent of the trials, choice of the two-pellet alternative resulted in a stimulus that always predicted ten food pellets; on the remaining 80 per cent of the trials, the two-pellet alternative resulted in a different stimulus that always predicted zero food pellets. Choice of the three-pellet alternative always resulted in three food pellets. This choice behaviour mimics human monetary gambling in which the infrequent occurrence of a stimulus signalling the winning event (10 pellets) is overemphasized and the more frequent occurrence of a stimulus signalling the losing event (zero pellets) is underemphasized, compared with the certain outcome associated with not gambling (the signal for three pellets). In experiment 2, choice of the two-pellet alternative resulted in ten pellets with a probability of 20 per cent following presentation of either stimulus. Choice of the three-pellet alternative continued to result in three food pellets. In this case, the pigeons reliably chose the alternative that provided a certain three pellets over the alternative that provided an average of two pellets. Thus, in experiment 1, the pigeons were responding to obtain the discriminative stimuli signalling reinforcement and the absence of reinforcement, rather than to obtain the variability in reinforcement.},

This discrepancy might be explained by the use of large nectar volumes in all published choice tests to date. Biophysical models predict that low concentrations maximize energy intake rates, and thus may be preferred, at small nectar volumes characteristic of the flowers that birds visit. Rufous hummingbirds',Selasphorus rufus, concentration preferences were tested and their energy intake rates measured at low volume with a computer-controlled food-delivery and activity-monitoring system. Contrary to the predictions of models, birds generally preferred 65\% sucrose over more dilute solutions. This preference generated near-maximal energy intake rates over the time scale of foraging bouts, even though rates over flower visits and shorter time scales suggested that lower concentrations would be more profitable. Neither hummingbirds' preferences nor the energetics of nectar extraction in this low-volume presentation account for the low nectar sugar concentrations characteristic of the flowers they pollinate.},

How the bee visual system manages this task is of interest for understanding information processing in miniaturized systems, as well as the relationship between bee pollinators and flowering plants. Bees can quickly discriminate dissimilar colours, but can also slowly learn to discriminate very similar colours, raising the question as to how the visual system can support this, or whether it is simply a learning and memory operation. We discuss the detailed neuroanatomical layout of the brain, identify probable brain areas for colour processing, and suggest that there may be multiple systems in the bee brain that mediate either coarse or fine colour discrimination ability in a manner dependent upon individual experience. These multiple colour pathways have been identified along both functional and anatomical lines in the bee brain, providing us with some insights into how the brain may operate to support complex colour discrimination behaviours.},

	abstract = {What is a “rational” decision? Economists traditionally viewed rationality as maximizing expected satisfaction. This view has been useful in modeling basic microeconomic concepts, but falls short in accounting for many everyday human decisions. It leaves unanswered why some things reliably make people more satisfied than others, and why people frequently act to make others happy at a cost to themselves. Drawing on an evolutionary perspective, we propose that people make decisions according to a set of principles that may not appear to make sense at the superficial level, but that demonstrate rationality at a deeper evolutionary level. By this, we mean that people use adaptive domain-specific decision-rules that, on average, would have resulted in fitness benefits. Using this framework, we re-examine several economic principles. We suggest that traditional psychological functions governing risk aversion, discounting of future benefits, and budget allocations to multiple goods, for example, vary in predictable ways as a function of the underlying motive of the decision-maker and individual differences linked to evolved life-history strategies. A deep rationality framework not only helps explain why people make the decisions they do, but also inspires multiple directions for future research.},

Moreover, across individuals, orbital and medial prefrontal cortex activity predicted a reduced susceptibility to the framing effect. This finding highlights the importance of incorporating emotional processes within models of human choice and suggests how the brain may modulate the effect of these biasing influences to approximate rationality.},

Our work aimed at assessing behavioural consistency in a social insect: the bumblebee Bombus terrestris. We focused on a behavioural dimension commonly used in personality studies: the response of an individual to novelty (neophilia/neophobia spectrum). We used a foraging paradigm to quantify individual bees' response to novel flower colours and to assess the repeatability of this response over time. As for vertebrates, most individual bumblebees responded to a novel stimulus by increasing the time they spent investigating it compared to known stimuli. Using a new statistical approach, the consistency model, we found that individual bees tended to be consistent in their response to novelty over a few hours but were not consistent in their behaviour over 3 days. We conclude that for the neophilia/neophobia paradigm used here, bumblebee foragers do not fulfil the criteria for animal personality in the common sense of the term. Instead their behavioural response to novelty appears to be plastic, varying on a day to day basis.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}A number of studies have observed that animals experiencing positive energy budgets tend to prefer alternatives offering constant amounts of food over those offering variable amounts of food, i.e. they tend to be risk averse. This observation, and the related finding that small animals experiencing negative energy budgets have been observed to prefer alternatives variable in food amount (i.e. to be risk prone), has often been explained by the hypothesis that animals choose the alternative with the highest expected utility. The present study examined if short-term differences in expected energy intake created by delays until when food is next available influence risk sensitivity in Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus). Norway rats were presented with choices between two feeding sites, one offering constant amounts of food, one offering variable amounts of food. In one treatment, rats could only sample one feeding site per daily trial (discrete-choice trials), in a second, they could sample both sites within a trial (free-choice trials), and in a third, they could sample the second-choice site after an imposed delay of 30 s. In the free-choice treatment, rats were indifferent to variability in food amount whereas in the discrete-choice treatment rats displayed a significant preference for the constant alternative. Therefore, the sensitivity the rats showed toward variability in food amount was influenced by the rats' expected energy intake in the period after visiting the first-choice patch. Rats in the free-choice with delay treatment displayed risk indifference just as those in the free-choice treatment did, however, indicating that differences in expected energy intake over a 30-s interval did not influence risk sensitivity.},

	abstract = {Interval timing—sensitivity to elapsing durations—has recently been found to occur in an invertebrate pollinator, the bumble-bee (Bombus impatiens). Here, bumble-bees were required to time the interval between the start of foraging in a patch of low-quality artificial flowers providing 25\% sucrose and the availability of a high-quality flower ({HQF}) that provided 50\% sucrose after a fixed delay. The delay changed after every 20 foraging bouts in the order 30–150–30 s. Bees visited the {HQF} sooner when the delay was 30 s than when it was 150 s, and visits to the {HQF} peaked near the end of both delays. When the delay changed to 150 s, bees appeared to time both the previous 30 s delay and the new delay. To examine whether bees also learned what kind of reward was provided at the {HQF}, its usual reward was replaced with 25\% sucrose in a final foraging bout. Bumble-bees rejected the {HQF} on the reward-replacement test. These results show that bumble-bees remembered both when reward was produced by the {HQF} and what type of reward was produced. These findings indicate that bumble-bees can learn both the timing and content of reward production.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}br/{\textgreater}Normative models of choice usually predict preferences between alternatives by computing their value according to some criterion, then identifying the alternative with greatest value. An important consequence of this procedure is captured in the economic concept of rationality, defined through a number of principles that are necessary for the existence of an ordinal scale of value upon which organisms base their choices. Violations of these principles, such as some recently reported breaches of transitivity and regularity in birds and honeybees, have strong implications for the understanding of decision mechanisms in humans and nonhumans alike. We investigated rationality in risky choice using European starlings, Sturnus vulgaris. Birds had to choose between two or three food sources, each associated with a different variance in delay to reward. In three experiments, starlings were strongly risk prone, showing regular and consistent preferences in binary and trinary choices. Preferences also satisfied weak and strong stochastic transitivity. Our results extend the generality of previous research in risk-sensitive foraging to situations where more than two alternatives are present and suggest that violations of rationality in risk-sensitive choices may be expressed only under restricted sets of conditions.

	abstract = {In most insect-pollinated flowers, pollinators cannot detect the presence of nectar without entering the flower. Therefore, flowers may cheat by not producing nectar and may still get pollinated. Earlier studies supported this 'cheater flower' hypothesis and suggested that the cost saving by cheater flowers could be the most predominant selective force in the evolution of nectarless flowers. Previous models as well as empirical studies have addressed the problem of optimizing the proportion of nectarless and nectarful flowers. However, there has been no attempt to optimize the investment in nectar production along with that in floral display. One of the key questions that arises is whether the floral display will evolve to be an honest indicator of nectar reward. We use a mathematical model to cooptimize the investments in nectar and floral display in order to achieve maximum reproductive success. The model assumes that pollinators rely on a relative rather than an absolute judgement of reward. A conspicuous floral display attracts naive pollinators on the one hand and enhances pollinator learning on the other. We show that under these assumptions, plant-pollinator co-evolution leads to honest signalling, i.e. a positive correlation between display and reward.},

These models generalise and extend a model of risk sensitive foraging originally proposed by Reboreda \& Kacelnik [(1991) Behav. Ecol. 2, 301-308], which yielded qualitative predictions (risk-aversion for amount of food and risk-proneness for delay to food). We now demonstrate how this approach can predict quantitatively the partial preferences between two alternative options with any mean and variance in their outcomes, and the certainty equivalent of an option consisting of any set of probabilistic outcomes. The approach is also relevant to the economics and psychology of risk sensitivity because it predicts risk aversion for any desirable outcome (such as monetary gains) and risk seeking for any undesirable gain (such as monetary losses). Our models are process-based rather than purely normative, and are based on linear expected utility as a function of expected outcomes. They do not account for all observed aspects of risky choice, but their descriptive performance betters that of existing functional models and requires fewer parameters.},

The drug solution is supplied by a dispenser with automated volume control. Animals are {PIT} microchip-tagged with {RFID} transponders and identified in realtime at the water port. Computer control permits preprogramming of individual reward quantities so that drug administration is terminated after an individual has collected its daily dose. For our experiments, the substance 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine ({BrdU}) was given as a marker of proliferating cells that we quantified in the hippocampus of adult mice. Experimental groups received {BrdU} either via intraperitoneal injections or orally via the water dispensers. Immunohistochemical staining of {BrdU}-positive cells was of the same quality after oral administration as after injection. {BrdU}-positive cells did not differ statistically in cell numbers. Thus, water dispensers under transponder control allow the individual and stress-free application of drugs even to group-living animals without disturbing their behavior. This is useful where a complex temporal protocol of application is required, and for phenotyping experiments combining behavioral tests with neural, cellular or molecular analyses.},

Bumblebee pollinators' responses to the increased standing crop of reward were consistent with predictions from optimal foraging theory and explain the increase in seed set. Pollinators both visited more flowers per inflorescence and spent more time in flowers on nectar-rich plants relative to controls. These results imply that D. nelsonii individuals could increase the female component (i.e. seed set) of plant fitness by increasing their nectar production rate. The results do not, however, allow an accurate assessment of the male component (i.e., pollen donation) of fitness. /// Растеня Delphinium nelsonii Greeni (Ranunculaceae), которые поливали, да-вали гораздо больше нектара в расчете на цветок, чем контрольные.

How quickly an animal responds to change will depend on the information available (cognitive, sensory, or physiological) and how it weights those types of information. Surrogate measures of meal size suggest that sensory information is used to make initial choices about how much to eat following changes in resource quality, choices are subsequently altered and refined as further information becomes available. Using direct measures, we investigated the amount of food consumed, the time taken to feed, and the interbout intervals between visits to a feeder of rufous hummingbirds, before and after changes in sucrose concentration. The hummingbirds did not change how much they drank at first experience of a new concentration but then rapidly adjusted meal sizes toward optimal for that concentration over a few feeding visits. Thus, it seems the hummingbirds used both cognitive and physiological information to decide how much to drink but appeared to ignore sensory information, such as taste. The early responses animals make to changed resources enable us to determine the types of information on which they rely most in their decision making.},

We addressed this question by scanning subjects with functional magnetic resonance imaging while they made real purchasing decisions among different categories of goods (food, nonfood consumables, and monetary gambles). We found activity in a key brain region previously implicated in encoding goal-values: the ventromedial prefrontal cortex ({vmPFC}) was correlated with the subjects' value for each category of good. Moreover, we found a single area in {vmPFC} to be correlated with the subjects' valuations for all categories of goods. Our results provide evidence that the brain encodes a “common currency” that allows for a shared valuation for different categories of goods.},

We show that length and numerosity are encoded by functionally overlapping groups of parietal neurons. Using a statistical classifier, we found that the activity of populations of quantity-selective neurons contained accurate information about continuous and discrete quantity. Unexpectedly, even neurons that were nonselective according to classical spike-count measures conveyed robust categorical information that predicted the monkeys' quantity judgments. Thus, different information-carrying processes of partly intermingled neuronal networks in the parietal lobe seem to encode various forms of abstract quantity.},

Contradictory evidence from in vitro studies of nutrient uptake capacity of intestinal tissues indicates a margin, however, that could allow a higher rate of energy acquisition than actually measured. As a more direct test, I measured nutrient uptake capacity in vivo. This is possible in animals such as the neotropical nectar-feeding bats (Glossophaginae: Phyllostomidae) that have both rapid gut transit times and high daily metabolic needs. Here, during the steady-state period of feeding, the rate of food intake is equal to the rate of food processing and food egestion. Therefore, the rate of food absorption can be determined directly from the rate of food ingestion. Maximal feeding rates were elicited by limiting the time period available for feeding during the 24-hr day through manipulation of the light/dark ({LD}) cycle. During 4-hr nights ({LD} 20:4), sugar intake averaged 488 J/g/hr and was 73\% higher than during 12-hr nights ({LD}12:12). A 16.4-g bat would assimilate 96 {kJ}/day if feeding at this maximal rate during a regular 12-hr foraging period. This would be sufficient for maintaining a positive energy balance even during extreme physical activity under the natural conditions of its tropical environment. Nutrient assimilation capacity could thus not be identified as the single central factor setting the metabolic ceiling.},

Humans sometimes appear to violate this assumption and employ relative, as opposed to absolute, currencies when making choices. Recent evidence suggests that animals too might sometimes employ relative choice mechanisms. We tested this idea by measuring the foraging preferences of rufous hummingbirds (Selasphorus rufus) faced with choices analogous to those in which human use of relative currencies is evident. The birds experienced three treatments: a binary choice between two artificial flower types designated concentration (20 microl, 40\% sucrose solution) and volume (40 microl, 20\%), and two trinary treatments in which a third decoy option (either concentration decoy: 10 microl, 30\% or volume decoy: 30 microl, 10\%) was added to the set. The birds' preferences differed significantly across the three treatments. In the trinary treatments, the effect of the decoy options was to increase the preference for the option that dominated the decoy. These results are similar to those reported in the human choice literature, and are compatible with the hummingbirds using a relative evaluation mechanism in decision making.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}br/{\textgreater}There is growing evidence that, rather than maximizing energy intake subject to constraints, many animals attempt to regulate intake of multiple nutrients independently. In the complex diets of animals such as herbivores, the consumption of nutritionally imbalanced foods is sometimes inevitable, forcing trade-offs between eating too much of nutrients present in the foods in relative excess against too little of those in deficit. Such situations are not adequately represented in existing formulations of foraging theory. Here we provide the necessary theory to fit this case, using an approach that combines state-space models of nutrition with Tilman's models of resource exploitation (Tilman 1982, Resource Competition and Community Structure, Princeton: Princeton University Press). Our approach was to construct a smooth fitness landscape over nutrient space, centred on a [`]target' intake at which no fitness cost is incurred, and this leads to a natural classification of the simple possible fitness landscapes based on Taylor series approximations of landscape shape. We next examined how needs for multiple nutrients can be assessed experimentally using direct measures of animal performance as the common currency, so that the nutritional strategies of animals can be mapped on to the performance surface, including the position of regulated points of intake and points of nutrient balance when fed suboptimal foods. We surveyed published data and conducted an experiment to map out the performance landscape of a generalist leaf-feeding caterpillar, Spodoptera littoralis.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

In this article frequency and density dependent fitness functions of optimal foraging are derived by separation of time scales in an underlying population dynamical model and corresponding evolutionarily stable strategies are calculated. Contrary to the classical foraging models the results of the present article predict that partial preferences occur in optimal foraging strategies as a consequence of the ecological feedback of consumer preferences on consumer fitness.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}This paper presents new results of risk-sensitive foraging studies of the carpenter bee, Xylocopa micans, and reviews the work to date on risk sensitivity in nectarivores. In the field, nectarivores choose among alternative food sources (flowers) that differ in the variabilities of their nectar rewards. In the lab, the foraging situation for carpenter bees was experimentally simplified by offering the bees a choice between either "low variance" or "high variance" artificial flowers. The two flower types differed in their variabilities but offered the same expected short-term rates of net energy gain to test the predictions of the short-term rate maximization mechanism. Foragers were tested under two energy budget conditions, hungry and well-fed, to test the predictions of the z-score model. Individual carpenter bees were indifferent to variability in both nectar volume and nectar sugar concentrations, and their risk-indifference was unaffected by energy budget. These findings of risk indifference support neither the variance discounting nor the z-score model of risk sensitivity. Since the low and high variance flower types are equivalent for carpenter bees in short-term rate of energy gain, there can be no selection on carpenter bees to be sensitive to variability based on differences in rate of gain. Studies of risk sensitivity in honey bees and bumble bees using variance in nectar concentration support this contention. These findings are compared with other nectarivore risk sensitivity studies in order to highlight the most likely mechanisms underlying aversion to variation in nectar rewards (short-term rate maximizing, the Weber-Fechner law of perception and learning non-empty flowers) and to suggest future research in the interplay of these three mechanisms.},

Sunbirds increased their feeding frequency on the most dilute diet, but there was no change in feeding duration. Thus, the increase in total time spent feeding on the dilute diet was due to the increased feeding frequency. No difference in short-term feeding patterns was found between the 20\% and 30\% diets. Total time spent feeding was extremely short on all diets (96-144 s in every hour). Birds maintained the same steady increase in body mass over the course of the day on all three diets. Daily rhythms in feeding patterns were evident, with longer feeding duration and lower feeding frequency in the early morning and evening than during the rest of the day. Because ingestion rates on a particular diet may vary through the day, caution must be exercised in using feeding duration as a surrogate for meal size. Individual birds varied greatly in their feeding patterns irrespective of diet concentration.},

If cognitive processes parallel perceptual processes, then fundamental psychophysical laws should hold for each. To test this, we analyzed both behavioral and neuronal representations of numerosity in the prefrontal cortex of rhesus monkeys. The data were best described by a nonlinearly compressed scaling of numerical information, as postulated by the Weber-Fechner law or Stevens' law for psychophysical/sensory magnitudes. This nonlinear compression was observed on the neural level during the acquisition phase of the task and maintained through the memory phase with no further compression. These results suggest that certain cognitive and perceptual/sensory representations share the same fundamental mechanisms and neural coding schemes.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

We conditioned each subject to turn its head and extend its proboscis towards one of two presented odors; one odor was associated with a constant reward and the other with a variable reward that was either low or high, with probabilities P and (1-P), respectively. Reward values and probabilities were set so that the expected value of the variable alternative was equal to that of the constant one. We performed six experimental conditions in which variability was in reward volume and three conditions in which variability was in reward concentration. The experiments were designed to systematically test the effect of various parameters that describe the reward distributions on levels of risk sensitivity. Risk aversion was greatest when variability was in reward volume, and the variable distribution included zero rewards and had a high coefficient of variation ({CV}=s.d./mean). The variance itself did not affect risk sensitivity. Subjects were risk indifferent when the variable distribution did not include zero rewards, however these distributions were positively skewed. The independent effects of zero rewards and distribution skew remain to be tested. Subjects were risk indifferent in conditions where variability was in reward concentration, but concentration range was limited and these distributions did not include zero rewards and were skewed. We conclude that risk aversion to variability in reward amount is a robust phenomenon for some reward distributions. A systematic evaluation of the effect of various reward distribution parameters on choice behavior should complement functional and mechanistic approaches.},

In this study, we propose the use of Bayesian inference to extract the information contained in experimental data to estimate the parameters of psychometric functions. Because Bayesian inference cannot be performed analytically, we describe how a Markov chain Monte Carlo method can be used to generate samples from the posterior distribution over parameters. These samples are used to estimate Bayesian confidence intervals and other characteristics of the posterior distribution. In addition, we discuss the parameterization of psychometric functions and the role of prior distributions in the analysis. The proposed approach is exemplified using artificially generated data and in a case study for real experimental data. Furthermore, we compare our approach with traditional methods based on maximum likelihood parameter estimation combined with bootstrap techniques for confidence interval estimation and find the Bayesian approach to be superior.},

	abstract = {{BackgroundCan} non-human animals comprehend and employ symbols? The most convincing empirical evidence comes from language-trained apes, but little is known about this ability in monkeys. Tokens can be regarded as symbols since they are inherently non-valuable objects that acquire an arbitrarily assigned value upon exchange with an experimenter. Recent evidence suggested that capuchin monkeys, which diverged from the human lineage 35 million years ago, can estimate, represent and combine token quantities. A fundamental and open question is whether monkeys can reason about symbols in ways similar to how they reason about real objects.Methodology/Principal {FindingsHere} we examined this broad question in the context of economic choice behavior. Specifically, we assessed whether, in a symbolic context, capuchins' preferences satisfy transitivity - a fundamental trait of rational decision-making. Given three options A, B and C, transitivity holds true if A≥B, B≥C and A≥C (where ≥ indicates preference). In this study, we trained monkeys to exchange three types of tokens for three different foods. We then compared choices monkeys made between different types of tokens with choices monkeys made between the foods. Qualitatively, capuchins' preferences revealed by the way of tokens were similar to those measured with the actual foods. In particular, when choosing between tokens, monkeys displayed strict economic preferences and their choices satisfied transitivity. Quantitatively, however, values measured by the way of tokens differed systematically from those measured with the actual foods. In particular, for any pair of foods, the relative value of the preferred food increased when monkeys chose between the corresponding tokens.Conclusions/{SignificanceThese} results indicate that indeed capuchins are capable of treating tokens as symbols. However, as they do so, capuchins experience the cognitive burdens imposed by symbolic representation.},

In one condition, continuous variables were controlled while numerical information was available; in another, the number was kept constant and information relating to continuous variables was available; in the third condition, stimuli differed for both number and continuous quantities. Fish learned to discriminate more quickly when both number and continuous information were available compared to when they could use continuous information only or number only; there was no difference in the learning rate between the two latter conditions. Our results do not support the hypothesis that processing numbers imposes a higher cognitive load than processing continuous variables.

	abstract = {In the temporal bisection task, participants classify experienced stimulus durations as short or long based on their temporal similarity to previously learned reference durations. Temporal decision making in this task should be influenced by the experienced probabilities of the reference durations for adaptiveness. In this study, we tested the temporal bisection performance of mice (Mus musculus) under different short and long reference duration probability conditions implemented across two experimental phases. In Phase 1, the proportion of reference durations (compared to probe durations) was 0.5, whereas in Phase 2 it was increased to 0.8 to further examine the adjustment of choice behavior with more frequent reference duration presentations (under higher reinforcement rate). Our findings suggest that mice developed adaptive biases in their choice behaviors. These adjustments in choice behavior were nearly optimal as the mice maximized their gain to a great extent which required them to monitor stimulus probabilities as well as the level of variability in their temporal judgments. We further found that short but not long categorization response times were sensitive to stimulus probability manipulations, which in turn suggests an asymmetry between short and long categorizations. Finally, we investigated the latent decision processes underlying the bias manifested in subjects' choice behavior within the diffusion model framework. Our results revealed that probabilistic information influenced the starting point and the rate of evidence accumulation process. Overall, the stimulus probability effects on choice behavior were modulated by the reinforcement rate. Our findings illustrate that mice can adapt their temporal behaviors with respect to the probabilistic contingencies in the environment.},

In particular, it is not well established if rats can process the topological structure of the environment in such a way that they are aware of the connections existing between remote places. Here, rats were first exposed for four 5-min trials to a complex environment divided into several sectors that were separated by doors allowing either unrestricted or restricted access to other sectors. In the fifth test trial, we measured the behavior of the animals while they explored the same environment in which, however, they faced changes that either altered or did not alter the topological structure of the environment. In experiment 1, closing previously opened doors prevented the rat from having direct access between corresponding sectors. In experiment 2, opening previously closed doors allowed direct access between sectors that had not been directly accessible. In each experiment, control doors allowed us to discard the mere influence of door manipulation. We compared the rats’ exploratory behavior in response to door manipulations that either strongly altered or did not alter the ability to commute between sectors and found evidence that the animals displayed differential reactions to the two types of door manipulations. This implies that during exploration rats build a precise map of the connectivity of space that can be flexibly updated and used for efficient navigation.},

Individual learning, unbiased and biased social learning, mixed learning, and learning schedules are considered. A rapidly changing environment or frequent migration in a spatially heterogeneous environment favors individual learning over unbiased social learning. However, results are not so straightforward in the context of learning schedules or when biases in social learning are introduced. The three major methods of modeling temporal environmental change–coevolutionary, two-timescale, and information decay–are compared and shown to sometimes yield contradictory results. The so-called Rogers’ paradox is inherent in the two-timescale method as originally applied to the evolution of pure strategies, but is often eliminated when the other methods are used. Moreover, Rogers’ paradox is not observed for the mixed learning strategies and learning schedules that we review. We believe that further theoretical work is necessary on learning schedules and biased social learning, based on models that are logically consistent and empirically pertinent.},

Most research has concentrated on apparent numerosity of spatial arrays of dots or other objects, but a truly abstract sense of number should be capable of encoding the numerosity of any set of discrete elements, however displayed and in whatever sensory modality. Here, we use the psychophysical technique of adaptation to study the sense of number for serially presented items. We show that numerosity of both auditory and visual sequences is greatly affected by prior adaptation to slow or rapid sequences of events. The adaptation to visual stimuli was spatially selective (in external, not retinal coordinates), pointing to a sensory rather than cognitive process. However, adaptation generalized across modalities, from auditory to visual and vice versa. Adaptation also generalized across formats: adapting to sequential streams of flashes affected the perceived numerosity of spatial arrays. All these results point to a perceptual system that transcends vision and audition to encode an abstract sense of number in space and in time.},

	abstract = {Delayed comparison tasks are widely used in the study of working memory and perception in psychology and neuroscience. It has long been known, however, that decisions in these tasks are biased. When the two stimuli in a delayed comparison trial are small in magnitude, subjects tend to report that the first stimulus is larger than the second stimulus. In contrast, subjects tend to report that the second stimulus is larger than the first when the stimuli are relatively large. Here we study the computational principles underlying this bias, also known as the contraction bias. We propose that the contraction bias results from a Bayesian computation in which a noisy representation of a magnitude is combined with a-priori information about the distribution of magnitudes to optimize performance. We test our hypothesis on choice behavior in a visual delayed comparison experiment by studying the effect of (i) changing the prior distribution and (ii) changing the uncertainty in the memorized stimulus. We show that choice behavior in both manipulations is consistent with the performance of an observer who uses a Bayesian inference in order to improve performance. Moreover, our results suggest that the contraction bias arises during memory retrieval/decision making and not during memory encoding. These results support the notion that the contraction bias illusion can be understood as resulting from optimality considerations.},

The aim of the paper is to examine the near-miss-to-Weber's law in the context of psychometric models of discrimination. We study two types of psychometric functions, characterized by the representations P a ( x ) = F ( ρ ( a ) x γ ( a ) ) (type A), and P a ( x ) = F ( γ ( a ) + ρ ( a ) x ) (type B). A central result shows that both types of psychometric functions are compatible with the near-miss-to-Weber's law. If a representation of type B exists, then the exponent in the near-miss is necessarily a constant function, that is, does not depend on the criterion value used to define “just noticeably different”. If, on the other hand, a representation of type A exists, then the exponent in the near-miss-to-Weber's law can vary with the criterion value. In that case, the parameters in the near-miss co-vary systematically.},

All models are based on the assumption that the model parameters might depend on the underlying physical stimulus scale by which the physical intensities are measured. By discussing the meaningfulness of the model parameters, we come to the conclusion that the near-miss-to-Weber's law can be applied to physical quantities which are measured on a ratio-, interval-, or log-interval scale, whereas applications of Weber's law and Guilford's power law are necessarily restricted to physical ratio scales. Finally, we discuss the meaningfulness of an empirically based submodel of the near-miss-to-Weber's law, referred to as fixed-point model.

In all cases, the relationships have to be encoded by the brain independently of the physical nature of objects linked by the relation. Consequently, concepts are associated with high levels of cognitive sophistication and are not expected in an insect brain. Yet, various works have shown that the miniature brain of honeybees rapidly learns conceptual relationships involving visual stimuli. Concepts such as ‘same’, ‘different’, ‘above/below of’ or ‘left/right are well mastered by bees. We review here evidence about concept learning in honeybees and discuss both its potential adaptive advantage and its possible neural substrates. The results reviewed here challenge the traditional view attributing supremacy to larger brains when it comes to the elaboration of concepts and have wide implications for understanding how brains can form conceptual relations.},

	abstract = {Nectar-feeding bats regulate their food ingestion in response to changes in sugar concentration as a way to achieve a constant energy intake. However, their digestive capability to assimilate sugars can limit their total energy intake, particularly when sugar concentration in nectar is low. Our experimental study evaluated the effect that changes in sugar concentration of nectar have on the foraging behavior of the nectar-feeding bats Glossophaga soricina and Leptonycteris yerbabuenae in captivity. We measured foraging behavior and food intake when bats fed at different concentrations of sucrose (5, 15, 25 and 35\%wt/vol.). To compensate for low-energy intake, both bat species reduced their flight time, and increased feeding time when sugar concentration decreased. Our results suggest that nectar-feeding bats in nature confront two scenarios with complementary ecological effects: 1) bats feeding on dilute nectars (i.e. ≤15\%wt/vol.) should increase the number of flowers visited per night enhancing pollination, and 2) bats feeding on concentrated nectars could spend more time flying, including long- and short-distance-flights increasing food patch exploration for use during subsequent nights, and thus enhancing plant gene flow. Further studies on foraging behavior of nectarivorous bats under natural conditions are necessary to corroborate these hypotheses.},

Because in the new world, the nectars of bat-pollinated flowers tend to be dominated by hexoses, we predicted that at equicaloric concentrations, bats would ingest higher volumes of hexoses than sucrose-containing nectars. We investigated the intake response of three species of Neotropical bats, Leptonycteris curasoae, Glossophaga soricina and Artibeus jamaicensis, to sugar solutions of varying concentrations (292, 438, 584, 730, 876, and 1,022 mmol L(-1)) consisting of either sucrose or 1:1 mixtures of glucose and fructose solutions. Bats did not show differences in their intake response to sucrose and 1:1 glucose-fructose solutions, indicating that digestion and absorption in bat intestines are designed under the principle of symmorphosis, in which no step is more limiting than the other. Our results also suggest that, on the basis of energy intake, bats should not prefer hexoses over sucrose. We used a mathematical model that uses the rate of sucrose hydrolysis measured in vitro and the small intestinal volume of bats to predict the rate of nectar intake as a function of sugar concentration. The model was a good predictor of the intake responses of L. curasoae and G. soricina, but not of A. jamaicensis.},

The algorithms are presented within a unified framework, thereby clarifying the similarities and differences of these methods. The author also presents new results regarding the role of mutation and selection in genetic algorithms, showing how mutation seems to be much more important for the performance of genetic algorithms than usually assumed. The interaction of selection and mutation, and the impact of the binary code are further topics of interest. Some of the theoretical results are also confirmed by performing an experiment in meta-evolution on a parallel computer. The meta-algorithm used in this experiment combines components from evolution strategies and genetic algorithms to yield a hybrid capable of handling mixed integer optimization problems.

Foraging from weak concentrations prior to and during testing led to a higher preference for the variable option, whereas foraging from strong concentrations led to an increased preference for the constant option. We suggest that the energetic conditions experienced by animals prior to testing had a significant impact on the animals’ risk-sensitive decisions, and their memories of those prior conditions may have played an additional role.

The optimal latency was arrived at so rapidly that there was no reliably discernible improvement over trials.

This paper relates the theoretical and methodological developments in the study of interval timing in the seconds, minutes and hours range to research on the anticipatory activity induced by regularly timed daily meals. Daily food anticipatory activity ({FAA}) is entrained by procedures which are formally identical to procedures studied in Pavlovian and Operant conditioning except for the long duration of the interval between feeding opportunities. As in {FAA}, the conditioning procedures induce orderly anticipatory activity in advance of food presentation. During the interval between foods the behaviors that express anticipation change as the interval progresses. Consequently, no single response represents a pure measure of anticipation. The ability to distinguish between properties of general anticipatory timing mechanisms such as the scalar property () and dynamic properties of specific response output systems has been facilitated by teaching animals to use arbitrary anticipatory responses like bar pressing to obtain food. Interval timing research highlights the importance of identifying the mechanisms of perception, memory, decision making and motivation that all contribute to food anticipation. We suggest that future work focused on the similarities and differences in the neural bases of {FAA} and interval timing may be useful in unravelling the mechanisms mediating timing behavior.},

Risk-sensitive foraging theory predicts that animals under energetic stress will prefer variable over constant food resources as a means of avoiding starvation. The foraging worker honey bee from a colony deprived of food should prefer to feed on variable flowers. Individual bees were given repeated binary choices between variable (10\% and 30\% mg solute/mg solution) and constant (20\% mg solute/mg solution) sucrose concentrations delivered in plastic flower tubes of different colours. Sucrose concentration, rather than sucrose volume, was varied so that bees feeding on either constant or variable flowers would experience equal mean sucrose concentrations (20\%) and nearly identical (on average within 0·04 J/s) net rates of energy gain. Honey combs were removed or added to a colony to alter the colony's energy state. There was no difference between the preferences of bees from colonies with large amounts of honey and those from colonies with small amounts of honey. Fifty-three per cent of the 9775 flower visits made by 40 bees were to constant flowers. Because of the large number of foraging bees in the colony and the large number of flower visits that individual honey bees make during each foraging trip, the colony achieves close to the true mean of variable resources. Hence, honey bees are little affected by the variance of resources.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The ability of invertebrates to perform nonelemental cognitive tasks is widely debated. Bees utilize the number of landmarks en-route to their destination as navigation cues, but their use of numerical information in other contexts is unknown. Numerical regularity in the spatial distribution of food occurs naturally in some flowers, which contain fixed numbers of nectaries. Nectar foragers on such flowers can increase their foraging efficiency by avoiding return visits to empty nectaries. This can occur if bees base their flower-departure decisions on the number of nectaries they had already visited. We tested, through field observations and laboratory experiments, whether bumblebees adapt their departure behavior to the number of available food resources. In bees that visited Alcea setosa flowers with 5 nectaries in the field, the conditional probability of flower departure after 5 probings was 92\%. Visit duration, the flowers’ spatial attributes, and scent marks could be excluded as flower-leaving cues. In the laboratory, bees foraged on 2 patches, each with 3 computer-controlled feeders, but could receive only up to 2 sucrose-solution rewards per patch visit. The foragers gradually increased their frequency of patch departure after the second reward. Patch-visit duration, nectar volume, scent marks, and recurring visit sequences in a patch were ruled out as possible sources of patch-leaving information. We conclude that bumblebees distinguish among otherwise identical stimuli by their serial position in a sequence and use this capability to forage efficiently. Our findings support an adaptive role for a complicated cognitive skill in a small invertebrate.},

It follows that animal choices should exhibit the rational property of regularity whereby the proportion of choices for an option cannot be increased by the addition of further options to the choice set. However, violations of regularity occur in human decision making, suggesting that humans may use comparative evaluation mechanisms whereby the value of an option is computed relative to the other options available. For example, in the asymmetrically dominated decoy effect the preference for a target option over a competitor is altered by the addition of a decoy option that is inferior to the target and competitor on one attribute, but lies between them on a second. We tested whether foraging wild rufous hummingbirds, Selasphorus rufus, would demonstrate violations of regularity in response to an asymmetrically dominated decoy. Sixteen birds chose between three artificial flower types (Target: 15 μl, 40\% sucrose; Competitor: 45 μl, 30\%; Decoy: 10 μl, 35\%) in Binary (Target versus Competitor) and Trinary (Target versus Competitor versus Decoy) treatments. We predicted higher preference for the Target in the Trinary treatment. The birds ranked the three options in the same order in the Binary and Trinary treatments (Competitor\&gt;Target\&gt;Decoy). Seven birds showed violations of regularity, six increasing their absolute preference for the Competitor in the Trinary treatment. Overall, relative preference for the Competitor over the Target was higher in the Trinary than in the Binary treatment. These changes in preference are incompatible with an absolute evaluation mechanism.},

	abstract = {Existing models of risk-sensitive foraging assume that animals assign value to different options according to an absolute currency. It follows from this assumption that choices are expected to be both transitive and regular, because the value assigned to an option is independent of its context. I tested these predictions by comparing preferences obtained in binary and trinary contexts. European starlings, Sturnus vulgaris, were trained using an operant paradigm to forage for three options: Constant (C) that provided a fixed number of food pellets; Low variance (L) with a coefficient of variation of 71\% in the number of pellets; High variance (H) with a coefficient of variation of 106\%. The preferences of the birds were tested in three binary choice treatments ({CL}, {CH}, {LH}) and one trinary choice treatment ({CLH}). Overall, there was no evidence for violations of either transitivity or regularity. However, overall, a bird's relative preference for its most preferred option over its second most preferred option was significantly greater in the trinary treatment than in the comparable binary treatment. This effect of context on choice is compatible with starlings' use of comparative instead of absolute currencies in decision making. Copyright 2002 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Here, we take advantage of the large number of studies that have estimated the repeatability of various behaviours to evaluate whether there is good evidence for consistent individual differences in behaviour and to answer some outstanding questions about possible factors that can influence repeatability. Specifically, we use meta-analysis to ask whether different types of behaviours were more repeatable than others, and if repeatability estimates depended on taxa, sex, age, field versus laboratory, the number of measures and the interval between measures. Some of the overall patterns that were revealed by this analysis were that repeatability estimates were higher in the field compared to the laboratory and repeatability was higher when the interval between observations was short. Mate preference behaviour was one of the best studied but least repeatable behaviours. Our findings prompt new insights into the relative flexibility of different types of behaviour and offer suggestions for the design and analysis of future research.},

We conducted two experiments on the {TSP} using Long-Evans laboratory rats as subjects. The first experiment examined the role of arena walls in route selection. Rats tend to display thigmotaxis in testing conditions comparable to the {TSP}, which could produce results similar to a convex hull type strategy suggested for humans. The second experiment examined the role of turn angle between targets along the optimal route, to determine whether rats exhibit a preferential turning bias. Our results indicated that both thigmotaxis and preferential turn angles do affect performance in the {TSP}, but neither is sufficient as a predictor of route choice in this task.},

	url = {http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1936199},
	abstract = {Evidence is presented in rodents, that individual differences in aggression reflect heritable, fundamentally different, but equally valuable alternative strategies to cope with environmental demands. Generally, aggressive individuals show an active response to aversive situations. In a social setting, they react with flight or escape when defeated; in non-social situations, they react with active avoidance of controllable shocks and with sustained activity during an uncontrollable task. In contrast, non-aggressive individuals generally adopt a passive strategy. In social and non-social aversive situations, they react with immobility and withdrawal. A main aspect of these two alternative strategies is that individuals with an active strategy easily develop routines (intrinsically determined behaviour), and consequently do not react (properly) to 'minor' changes in their environment, whereas in passively reacting animals it is just the other way around (extrinsically determined behaviour). It has become clear that active and passive behavioural strategies represent two different, but equivalent, coping styles. The coping style of the aggressive males is aimed at the removal of themselves from the source of stress or at removal of the stress source itself (i.e. active manipulation). Non-aggressive individuals seem to aim at the reduction of the emotional impact of the stress (i.e. passive confrontation). The success of both coping styles depends upon the variability or stability of the environment. The fact that aggressive males develop routines may contribute to a fast execution of their anticipatory responses, which is necessary for an effective manipulation of events. However, this is only of advantage in predictable (stable) situations, but is maladaptive (e.g. expressed by the development of stress pathologies) when the animal is confronted with the unexpected (variable situations). The flexible behaviour of non-aggressive individuals, depending strongly upon external stimuli, will be of advantage under changing conditions. Studies on wild house mice living under natural conditions show how active and passive coping functions in nature, and how the two types have been brought about by natural selection.},

Here, we report that homogamy in humans is attained partly by sexual imprinting on the opposite–sex parent during childhood. We hypothesized that children fashion a mental model of their opposite–sex parent's phenotype that is used as a template for acquiring mates. To disentangle the effects of phenotypic matching and sexual imprinting, adopted daughters and their rearing families were examined. Judges found significant resemblance on facial traits between daughter's husband and her adoptive father. Furthermore, this effect may be modified by the quality of the father–daughter relationship during childhood. Daughters who received more emotional support from their adoptive father were more likely to choose mates similar to the father than those whose father provided a less positive emotional atmosphere.},

Here, we examined the role of sleep in the object-place recognition task, a task closely comparable to tasks typically applied for testing human declarative memory: It is a one-trial task, hippocampus-dependent, not stressful and can be repeated within the same animal. A test session consisted of the Sample trial, followed by a 2-h retention interval and a Test trial, the latter examining the memory the rat had for the places of two objects presented at the Sample trial. In Experiment 1, each rat was tested twice, with the retention interval taking place either in the morning or evening, i.e., in the inactive or active phase, respectively. Rats showed significantly (p \&lt; 0.01) better memory for object place after the Morning session. To control for confounding circadian factors, in Experiment 2 rats were tested four times, i.e., in the morning or in the evening while sleep was or was not deprived. Sleep during the retention interval was recorded polysomnographically. Rats only showed significant memory for the target object place in the Test trial after the Morning retention interval in the absence of sleep deprivation, and recognition performance in this condition was significantly superior to that in the three other conditions (p \&lt; 0.05). {EEG} recordings during spontaneous morning sleep revealed increased slow oscillation (0.85–2.0 Hz) and upper delta (2.0–4.0 Hz), but reduced spindle band (10.5–13.5 Hz) activity, as compared to evening sleep. However, spindle band power was increased in the Morning retention interval in comparison to a Morning Baseline period (p \&lt; 0.05). We conclude that consolidation of object-place memory depends on sleep, and presumably requires {NonREM} sleep rich in both slow wave and spindle activity.},

The first is the matrix of nonlinear selection gradients (gamma) which describes the individual fitness surface. The second is the genetic variance-covariance matrix (G) that influences the multivariate response to selection. A common approach to the empirical analysis of these matrices is the element-by-element testing of significance, and subsequent biological interpretation of pattern based on these univariate and bivariate parameters. Here, I show why this approach is likely to misrepresent the genetic basis of quantitative traits, and the selection acting on them in many cases. Diagonalization of square matrices is a fundamental aspect of many of the multivariate statistical techniques used by biologists. Applying this, and other related approaches, to the analysis of the structure of gamma and G matrices, gives greater insight into the form and strength of nonlinear selection, and the availability of genetic variance for multiple traits.},

Such an effect requires predators to respond to changes in the relative abundance of prey, switching to alternatives when a focal prey type becomes less common,. Apostatic selection has often been investigated using fixed relative proportions of prey,, but its effects on predator–prey dynamics have been difficult to demonstrate. Here we report results from a new technique that incorporates computer-generated displays, into an established experimental system, that of blue jays (Cyanocitta cristata) hunting for cryptic Catocala moths. Digital prey images from a virtual population are presented to predators. The relative numbers that escape detection determine the subsequent abundance of each prey type. If apostatic selection does promote stability, the system should converge on an eqlibrium in which each prey type appears at a characteristic abundance. Our results show that the detection of cryptic prey does involve apostatic selection, and that such selection can function to maintain prey polymorphism.},

Moth phenotypes evolved via a genetic algorithm in which individuals detected by the jays were much less likely to reproduce. Jays often failed to detect atypical cryptic moths, confirming frequency-dependent selection and suggesting the use of searching images, which enhance the detection of common prey.

Visual predators promote such phenotypic variation through apostatic selection, in which they attack more abundant prey types disproportionately often. In heterogeneous environments, disruptive selection to match the coloration of disparate habitat patches could also produce polymorphism, but how apostatic and disruptive selection interact in these circumstances is unknown. Here we report the first controlled selection experiment on the evolution of prey coloration on heterogeneous backgrounds, in which blue jays (Cyanocitta cristata) searched for digital moths on mixtures of dark and light patches at three different scales of heterogeneity. As predicted by ecological theory, coarse-grained backgrounds produced a functional dimorphism of specialists on the two patch types; fine-grained backgrounds produced generalists. The searching strategies of the jays also varied with the habitat configuration, however. Complex backgrounds with many moth-like features elicited a slow, serial search that depended heavily on selective attention. The result was increased apostatic selection, producing a broad range of moth phenotypes. Backgrounds with larger, more uniform patches allowed the birds to focus on the currently most rewarding patch type and to search entire patches rapidly in parallel. The result was less apostatic selection and lower phenotypic variability. The evolution of polymorphism in camouflaged prey depends on a complex interaction between habitat structure and predator cognition.},

	abstract = {The orchid bee Euglossa imperialis sucks nectars through a slender proboscis. I tested how nectar properties influence this suction pressure and whether ambient air pressure sets the upper limit for suction feeding. Nectar intake rate was measured as a function of sucrose concentration (5-75\% w/w), nectar viscosity (2-80 {mPa} s), and ambient pressure (101-40 {kPa}). Intake rate declines from about 1.2 mul s(-1) to 0.003 mul s(-1) as sucrose concentration increases from 15\% to 65\% sucrose. When sucrose concentration is held at 25\% while viscosity increases from 2 to 80 {mPa} s, intake rate declines. When viscosity is held at 10.2 {mPa} s (the viscosity of 50\% sucrose) while sucrose concentration increases from 5\% to 50\%, intake rate remains constant. Intake rate was limited by a reduction in ambient pressure at all nectar concentrations. Assuming a rigid proboscis, the Hagen-Poiseuille equation suggests that suction pressure increases with viscosity from 10 {kPa} at 5\% sucrose to 45 {kPa} at 65\% sucrose. However, because intake rate declined by the same fraction under hypobaria (40 {kPa}) at all sucrose concentrations, the euglossine bee proboscis may be better described as a collapsible tube: expanding or collapsing depending on the flow rate, the pressure gradient along the proboscis, and circumferential forces imposed by the proboscis walls.},

	abstract = {Summary 
Although deception of floral pollinators is well known among orchids [1, 2], the majority of animal-pollinated plants secure pollination by nectar rewards. The costs and benefits of nectar production remain poorly understood [3–5]. Here, we developed a crossing design to introgress a low-nectar-volume locus of Petunia integrifolia into the genetic background of P. axillaris. The resulting introgression line resembled P. axillaris but produced only one-third of the nectar volume. When exposed simultaneously to low-nectar and wild-type P. axillaris plants, hawkmoth pollinators reduced their probing duration on low-nectar plants but otherwise did not show any signs of discrimination against these plants. However, reduced probing duration resulted in reduced seed production in the low-nectar plants despite their higher reproductive potential as evidenced by hand pollination. In line with this interpretation, we found a positive correlation between probing duration and seed set, and hawkmoth pollination of low-nectar plants that were manually supplemented with nectar to parental levels yielded seed sets similar to hand pollination. Thus, a simple self-serving pollinator behavior—the adjustment of probing time in response to nectar volume—may select against reducing nectar and protect many plant-pollinator mutualisms against a drift toward parasitism.

Subsequent decades of research have confirmed that the interactions between the various learning systems engaged during operant conditioning are complex and difficult to disentangle. Today, modern neurobiological tools allow us to dissect the biological processes underlying operant conditioning and study their interactions. These processes include initiating spontaneous behavioral variability, world-learning and self-learning. The data suggest that behavioral variability is generated actively by the brain, rather than as a by-product of a complex, noisy input-output system. The function of this variability, in part, is to detect how the environment responds to such actions. World-learning denotes the biological process by which value is assigned to environmental stimuli. Self-learning is the biological process which assigns value to a specific action or movement. In an operant learning situation using visual stimuli for flies, world-learning inhibits self-learning via a prominent neuropil region, the mushroom-bodies. Only extended training can overcome this inhibition and lead to habit formation by engaging the self-learning mechanism. Self-learning transforms spontaneous, flexible actions into stereotyped, habitual responses.},

Biologists interpreting these results in terms of bird sugar preference have seldom taken these differences into account. The consequences of using different experimental procedures for sugar preferences exhibited by a nectarivorous bird, the malachite sunbird Nectarinia famosa, were examined using paired sucrose and hexose sugar solutions made up to be either equimolar, equiweight or equicaloric. We found the effect of methodology on bird sugar preference to be quite distinct, especially at low concentrations, where malachite sunbirds showed either sucrose preference, no preference, or hexose preference, depending on the method used.

	abstract = {Experiments testing for variance-sensitivity (also called risk-sensitivity) usually offer 2 options delivering identical expected payoffs, with one option providing a constant and the other one a variable reward or delay. Animals often show a preference for the constant option when variance is in amount (variance-aversion) and a preference for the variable option when variance is in delay (variance-proneness). Variance-sensitivity is a taxonomically widespread phenomenon. Variance-sensitive foraging preferences contradict predictions derived from evolutionarily motivated models that emphasize long-term energetic benefits. We discuss a new approach of explaining variance-sensitive preferences. We hypothesize that variance-sensitivity results from decision mechanisms that are adjusted to ensure close to optimal responses to the environment. This paper demonstrates that simple decision rules ensure long-term rate maximization and exhibit variance-sensitive behavior when tested in a classical risk-sensitivity situation. We also show that behavioral patterns observed in experiments like preferences for constant reward amounts and variable time delays are produced by the decision rules. The decision rules presented here are a first step toward a decision mechanism that is psychologically plausible, is advantageous in natural foraging situations, and explains irrational behavior-like variance-sensitivity.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}In a controlled laboratory experiment, we re-examined the question of bumble bee risk-sensitivity. Harder and Real's (1987) analysis of previous work on bumble bee risk aversion suggests that risk-sensitivity in these organisms is a result of their maximizing the net rate of energy return (calculated as the average of expected per flower rates). Whether bees are risk-sensitive foragers with respect to minimizing the probability of energetic shortfall is therefore still an open question. We examined how the foraging preferences of bumble bees for nectar reward variation were affected by colony energy reserves, which we manipulated by draining or adding sucrose solution to colony honey pots. Nine workers from four confined colonies of Bombus occidentalis foraged for sucrose solution in two patches of artificial flowers. These patches yielded the same expected rate of net energy intake, but floral volumes were variable in one patch and constant in the other. Our results show that bumble bees can be both risk-averse (preferring constant flowers) and risk-prone (preferring variable flowers), depending on the status of their colony energy reserves. Diet choice in bumble bees appears to be sensitive to the "target value" of a colony-level energetic requirement.},

In this study, cuttlefish were trained to solve a Y-maze with the e-vector of a polarized light and landmarks as redundant spatial information. The results showed that cuttlefish can use the e-vector orientation and landmarks in parallel to orient and that they are able to use either type of cue when the other one is missing. When they faced conflicting spatial information in the experimental apparatus, the majority of cuttlefish followed the e-vector rather than landmarks. Differences in response latencies in the different conditions of testing (training with both types of cue, tests with single cue or with conflicting information) were observed and discussed in terms of decision making. The ability to use near field and far field information may enable animals to interpret the partially occluded underwater light field.},

Plant species were classified into flower type categories based not only on floral features but also on data from the literature and field observations on their pollinators.• Key Results Most data on nectar are new reports at the generic and/or specific level. Plant species in which more than one population was studied showed significant among-population variation in nectar sugar concentration and composition. Results showed a weak relationship between nectar traits and flower type. Many species had nectar containing 50 \% or more sucrose (17 of 26 species), independent of the main pollinator.• Conclusions Considering that (a) nectar characteristics did not show a clear association with different flower types or with plant taxonomic membership, and (b) different populations of the same species showed large variability in sugar composition, the results suggest that other factors (e.g. historical and environmental) could be involved in determining the sugar composition of the highly endemic plant species from this region.},

	abstract = {What rules determine whether bumble bees continue exploiting plants of the species just visited or switch to another species? To tackle this question, we recorded handling times and flight times from bees foraging in a natural meadow containing five plant species. Inter- and intra-specific plant distances were quantified. The bee-subjective colors of the five species were determined; two of these species had similar colors and structures, while three species were distinct from all others. The following rules were identified: (1) The decision to switch species was correlated with previous flower handling time, which we assume is a function of the reward amount received at the flower. After short handling times, the probability of switching to another species increased, whereas it decreased after long handling times. This difference became even greater if the bee had had a run of several short or several long handling times. (2) Constant flights (those between flowers of the same species) and transition flights (those between flowers of different species) followed stereotyped temporal patterns independent of the distances between flowers. Constant flights within five plant species consistently had median durations of about 2 seconds, whereas median transition times between species took 3–6 seconds. (3) This temporal rule broke down, however, if the flowers of two species had similar colors, in which case transition flights had equal dynamics as constant flights. (4) Bees switched more frequently from rare than from common species but even more frequently between similar species. We conclude that the bees' choices were determined by a set of rules that guided them to stay with the current plant species as long as flowers were rewarding and available within close distance but to switch to another species if flowers offered low rewards or were not encountered at close range},

The same overt cognitive capacity might be mediated by entirely different neural circuitries in different species, with a many-to-one mapping between behavioural routines, computations and their neural implementations. Comparative behavioural research needs to be complemented with a bottom-up approach in which neurobiological and molecular-genetic analyses allow pinpointing of underlying neural and genetic bases that constrain cognitive variation. Often, only very minor differences in circuitry might be needed to generate major shifts in cognitive functions and the possibility that cognitive traits arise by convergence or parallel evolution needs to be taken seriously. Hereditary variation in cognitive traits between individuals of a species might be extensive, and selection experiments on cognitive traits might be a useful avenue to explore how rapidly changes in cognitive abilities occur in the face of pertinent selection pressures.},

However, as time passes the information they learned about the risk level associated with the predator decreases in value. As the certainty of the information decreases, there should be a point in time when the prey should stop responding to the information. Here, we conditioned tadpoles to recognize a tiger salamander, fire belly newt, or goldfish and found that they responded to each of the 3 predators with an equal response both 1 day and 8 days postconditioning. Subsequently, we reconditioned each of the groups to recognize tiger salamanders alone and found that the duration of time for which the tadpoles responded to the tiger salamander cue was influenced by what the tadpoles learned in the past. Tadpoles conditioned twice to the tiger salamander retained their response the longest, whereas tadpoles taught goldfish and then tiger salamander responded to the tiger salamander for the least time. Those learning the newt and then the tiger salamander retained their response to the tiger salamander for an intermediate amount of time, indicating that information gained through predator generalization influences the retention of responses to predators.

	abstract = {* Omnivory enables animals to fill more than one trophic niche, providing access to a wider variety of food resources with potentially higher nutrient value, particularly when resources become scarce. Animals can achieve omnivory using different strategies, for example opportunistic foraging, or switching between multiple trophic niches. * The Neotropical bat Glossophaga soricina (Pallas, 1766) is a common and widespread species known for nectar feeding, but it also eats fruit and insects. Approaching stationary objects (flowers and fruits) or moving objects (insects) poses different sensory tasks and should require different echolocation behaviours. Here we tested the contrasting hypothesis that G. soricina can approach both stationary and moving objects using the same echolocation behaviour, thus feeding at different trophic levels by a single sensory mechanism. * Using {DNA} barcoding, we demonstrate that G. soricina eats beetles (Coleoptera), flies (Diptera) and noctuid moths with bat-detecting ears. Laboratory observations show that G. soricina actively hunts for prey so insect consumption does not appear to be opportunistic. After capture, individuals consumed prey while perched and manipulated them with jaw, thumb, wrist and wing movements, but food handling was longer and chewing rate slower than in obligate insectivores. * In contrast to most insectivorous bats, the echolocation calls of G. soricina are of high frequency and low intensity, and G. soricina did not produce feeding buzzes when approaching insects. An acoustic model of detection distances shows that its low-intensity calls fail to trigger the auditory neurons of eared moths, allowing G. soricina to overcome auditory prey defences. * Individuals achieved niche flexibility using a unique but generalist behavioural approach rather than employing two different specialist methods. Our findings provide a novel insight into the functional mechanisms of insect capture in G. soricina and highlight the importance of considering niche flexibility in classifying trophic links in ecological communities.},

	abstract = {{ABSTRACT} In the past few decades, sex differences in spatial cognition have often been attributed to adaptation in response to natural selection. A common explanation is that home range size differences between the sexes created different cognitive demands pertinent to wayfinding in each sex and resulted in the evolution of sex differences in spatial navigational ability in both humans and nonhuman mammals. However, the assumption of adaptation as the appropriate mode of explanation was nearly simultaneous with the discovery and subsequent verification of the male superiority effect, even without any substantive evidence establishing a causal role for adaptation. An alternate possibility that the sex difference in cognition is a genetic or hormonal side effect has not been rigorously tested using the comparative method. The present study directly evaluates how well the range hypothesis fits the available data on species differences in spatial ability by use of a phylogenetically based, cross-species, comparative analysis. We find no support for the hypothesis that species differences in home range size dimorphism are positively associated with parallel differences in spatial navigation abilities. The alternative hypothesis that sex differences in spatial cognition result as a hormonal side effect is better supported by the data.},

	abstract = {A coping style (also termed behavioural syndrome or personality) is defined as a correlated set of individual behavioural and physiological characteristics that is consistent over time and across situations. This relatively stable trait is a fundamental and adaptively significant phenomenon in the biology of a broad range of species, i.e. it confers differential fitness consequences under divergent environmental conditions. Behavioural flexibility appears to be an important underlying attribute or feature of the coping style that might explain consistency across situations. Proactive coping is characterized by low flexibility expressed as rather rigid, routine-like behavioural tendencies and reduced impulse control (behavioural inhibition) in operant conditioning paradigms. This article summarizes some of the evidence that individual differentiation in behavioural flexibility emerges as a function of underlying variability in the activation of a brain circuitry that includes the prefrontal cortex and its key neurochemical signalling pathways (e.g. dopaminergic and serotonergic input). We argue that the multidimensional nature of animal personality and the terminology used for the various dimensions should reflect the differential pattern of activation of the underlying neuronal network and the behavioural control function of its components. Accordingly, unravelling the molecular mechanisms that give rise to individual differences in the coping style will be an important topic in biobehavioural neurosciences, ecology and evolutionary biology.},

In nonverbal tests, transitive inference has been demonstrated in preschool children and 2 species of nonhuman primates. In these experiments, evidence of transitive inference in rats is demonstrated. An ordered series of 5 olfactory stimuli (A {\textless} B {\textless} C {\textless} D {\textless} E) was used from which correct inferences were made about the novel B vs D pair. Control procedures indicated that performance did not depend on the recency with which the correct answer was rewarded during training and may be disrupted by the addition of logically inconsistent premises (F {\textgreater} E and A {\textgreater} F). The possibility that logical transitivity may reflect a form of spatial paralogic rather than formal deductions from a syllogistic–verbal system is discussed.},

	abstract = {Decision making in an uncertain environment poses a conflict between the opposing demands of gathering and exploiting information. In a classic illustration of this ‘exploration–exploitation’ dilemma, a gambler choosing between multiple slot machines balances the desire to select what seems, on the basis of accumulated experience, the richest option, against the desire to choose a less familiar option that might turn out more advantageous (and thereby provide information for improving future decisions). Far from representing idle curiosity, such exploration is often critical for organisms to discover how best to harvest resources such as food and water. In appetitive choice, substantial experimental evidence, underpinned by computational reinforcement learning ({RL}) theory, indicates that a dopaminergic, striatal and medial prefrontal network mediates learning to exploit. In contrast, although exploration has been well studied from both theoretical and ethological perspectives, its neural substrates are much less clear. Here we show, in a gambling task, that human subjects' choices can be characterized by a computationally well-regarded strategy for addressing the explore/exploit dilemma. Furthermore, using this characterization to classify decisions as exploratory or exploitative, we employ functional magnetic resonance imaging to show that the frontopolar cortex and intraparietal sulcus are preferentially active during exploratory decisions. In contrast, regions of striatum and ventromedial prefrontal cortex exhibit activity characteristic of an involvement in value-based exploitative decision making. The results suggest a model of action selection under uncertainty that involves switching between exploratory and exploitative behavioural modes, and provide a computationally precise characterization of the contribution of key decision-related brain systems to each of these functions.},

(2004)Neuron, 41, 165-173]. Populations of neurons for each decision in a biased competition attractor network receive a bias input that depends on the firing rates of {VPC} neurons that code for the two vibrotactile frequencies. The firing rate of the neurons in whichever attractor wins, reflects the sign of the difference in the frequencies (Deltaf) being compared but not the absolute frequencies. However, the transition from the initial spontaneous firing state to one of the two possible attractor states depends probabilistically on the difference of the vibrotactile frequencies scaled by the base frequency. This is due to finite size noise effects related to the spiking activity in the network, and the divisive feedback inhibition implemented through inhibitory interneurons. Thus the neurophysiological basis for a psychophysical effect, Weber's Law, can be related to statistical fluctuations and divisive inhibition in an attractor decision-making network.},

At all ages, the Mundurucu mapped symbolic and nonsymbolic numbers onto a logarithmic scale, whereas Western adults used linear mapping with small or symbolic numbers and logarithmic mapping when numbers were presented nonsymbolically under conditions that discouraged counting. This indicates that the mapping of numbers onto space is a universal intuition and that this initial intuition of number is logarithmic. The concept of a linear number line appears to be a cultural invention that fails to develop in the absence of formal education.},

The first concerns the role of associatively activated representations, whereas the second is the development of hybrid theories in which learning is determined by prediction errors, both directly and indirectly through associability processes. However, it remains unclear whether these developments allow associative theory to capture the psychological rationality of cognition. I argue that embodying associative processes within specific processing architectures provides mechanisms that can mediate psychological rationality and illustrate such embodiment by discussing the relationship between practical reasoning and the associative-cybernetic model of goal-directed action.},

We detail the shortcomings of current methods aimed at describing variation in behavioural syndromes, such as multiple pairwise correlations and principal components analysis ({PCA}). In their place we propose an alternative statistical framework involving: (1) calculation of trait variance–covariance and correlation matrices within each data set; (2) statistical evaluation of specific hypotheses regarding how behaviours covary within a behavioural syndrome; and (3) statistical comparison of behavioural covariances across data sets using structural equation modelling ({SEM}). Given their unfamiliarity to most behavioural ecologists, we illustrate these methods using an already published data set for two groups of populations of three-spined stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus, living in ponds with and without fish predators. Previous analyses suggested a lack of behavioural syndrome structure for stickleback that lived in the absence of fish predators. However, by evaluating a priori hypotheses of how behaviours might covary using {SEM}, we were able to demonstrate that the two types of populations differed specifically in covariance patterns for aggression, exploration of novel food sources and altered environments, but not for exploration of novel environments and activity. Such detailed inferences cannot readily be made based on conventional statistical approaches alone, and so the methods we outline here should become standard in studies concerning the evolution of behavioural syndromes within and between populations.},

Here we provide an overview of the available literature on the fitness consequences of personality traits in natural populations. We start by a description of two case studies that have examined the role of natural selection on personality traits in the wild (i.e., the great tit, Parus major and bighorn sheep, Ovis canadensis), and review other studies that have reported some links between personality traits and fitness indices, in a large variety of animal species.

Whether behavioral syndromes also influence the course of evolution in this manner remains unknown. Here, we provide the first test of the degree to which evolutionary responses might be affected by behavioral syndrome structure. This test, based on a meta-analysis of additive genetic variance–covariance matrices, shows that behavioral syndromes constrain potential evolutionary responses by an average of 33\%. For comparison, correlations between life-history or between morphological traits suggest constraints of 13–18\%. This finding demonstrates that behavioral syndromes might substantially constrain the evolutionary trajectories available to populations, prompts novel future directions for the study of behavioral syndromes, emphasizes the importance of viewing syndrome research from an evolutionary perspective, and provides a bridge between syndrome research and theoretical quantitative genetics.},

	abstract = {Behavioural syndromes, correlations of behaviours conceptually analogous to personalities, have been a topic of recent attention due to their potential to explain trade-offs in behavioural responses, apparently maladaptive behaviour and limits to plasticity. Using Merriam's kangaroo rats (Dipodomys merriami), we assessed the explanatory power and generality of hypothesized syndrome structures derived from the literature and the natural history of the species. Several aspects of functionally distinct behavioural responses of D. merriami were quantified. Syndrome structures were compared using structural equation modelling and model selection procedures. A domain-general behavioural syndrome incorporating cross-functional relationships between measures of boldness, agonistic behaviour, flexibility and food hoarding best explained the data. This pattern suggests that D. merriami behaviours should not be viewed as discrete elements but as components of a multivariate landscape. Our results support arguments that a lack of independence between behaviours may be a general aspect of behavioural phenotypes and suggest that the ability of D. merriami's behaviour to respond to selection may be constrained by underlying connections.},

Here I consider computational factors that can affect decision making and review anatomical structures and neurochemical systems that are related to contextual modulation of decision making. Expectation of a high reward can motivate a subject to go for an action despite a large cost, a decision that is influenced by dopamine in the anterior cingulate cortex. Uncertainty of action outcomes can promote risk taking and exploratory choices, in which norepinephrine and the orbitofrontal cortex appear to be involved. Predictable environments should facilitate consideration of longer-delayed rewards, which depends on serotonin in the dorsal striatum and dorsal prefrontal cortex. This article aims to sort out factors that affect the process of decision making from the viewpoint of reinforcement learning theory and to bridge between such computational needs and their neurophysiological substrates.},

	abstract = {In order to understand the development of non-genetically encoded actions during an animal’s lifespan, it is necessary to analyze the dynamics and evolution of learning rules producing behavior. Owing to the intrinsic stochastic and frequency-dependent nature of learning dynamics, these rules are often studied in evolutionary biology via agent-based computer simulations. In this paper, we show that stochastic approximation theory can help to qualitatively understand learning dynamics and formulate analytical models for the evolution of learning rules. We consider a population of individuals repeatedly interacting during their lifespan, and where the stage game faced by the individuals fluctuates according to an environmental stochastic process. Individuals adjust their behavioral actions according to learning rules belonging to the class of experience-weighted attraction learning mechanisms, which includes standard reinforcement and Bayesian learning as special cases. We use stochastic approximation theory in order to derive differential equations governing action play probabilities, which turn out to have qualitative features of mutator-selection equations. We then perform agent-based simulations to find the conditions where the deterministic approximation is closest to the original stochastic learning process for standard 2-action 2-player fluctuating games, where interaction between learning rules and preference reversal may occur. Finally, we analyze a simplified model for the evolution of learning in a producer–scrounger game, which shows that the exploration rate can interact in a non-intuitive way with other features of co-evolving learning rules. Overall, our analyses illustrate the usefulness of applying stochastic approximation theory in the study of animal learning.},

We analyzed data from previous experiments to determine how recent foraging experience by bumble bees affects their flight distances to subsequent flowers. A single visit to a flower was sufficient to affect the flight distance to the next flower. However, longer sequences of two or three visits had an additional effect on the subsequent flight distance of individual foragers. This suggests that bumble bees can integrate information from at least three flowers for making a subsequent foraging decision. The existence of memory for floral characteristics at least at this scale may have significance for floral selection in natural environments.},

We explored how lifespan was affected by the dietary protein-to-carbohydrate ratio and the duration of exposure to a high-protein diet. We show that (i) restriction to high-protein, low-carbohydrate diets decreased worker lifespan by up to 10-fold; (ii) reduction in lifespan on such diets was mainly due to elevated intake of protein rather than lack of carbohydrate; and (iii) only one day of exposure to a high-protein diet had dire consequences for workers and the colony, reducing population size by more than 20 per cent.},

	abstract = {Economic models of animal behaviour assume that decision-makers are rational, meaning that they assess options according to intrinsic fitness value and not by comparison with available alternatives. This expectation is frequently violated, but the significance of irrational behaviour remains controversial. One possibility is that irrationality arises from cognitive constraints that necessitate short cuts like comparative evaluation. If so, the study of whether and when irrationality occurs can illuminate cognitive mechanisms. We applied this logic in a novel setting: the collective decisions of insect societies. We tested for irrationality in colonies of Temnothorax ants choosing between two nest sites that varied in multiple attributes, such that neither site was clearly superior. In similar situations, individual animals show irrational changes in preference when a third relatively unattractive option is introduced. In contrast, we found no such effect in colonies. We suggest that immunity to irrationality in this case may result from the ants’ decentralized decision mechanism. A colony's choice does not depend on site comparison by individuals, but instead self-organizes from the interactions of multiple ants, most of which are aware of only a single site. This strategy may filter out comparative effects, preventing systematic errors that would otherwise arise from the cognitive limitations of individuals.},

P. ellipticum (Bombacaceae) presents big flowers (red or white) that produce nectar during the night and the following morning. At night three species of bats (L. sanborm, C. mexicana, and G. leachii, Family Phyllostomidae) visited the flowers rapidly and always carried mixed pollen loads (of P. ellipticum and Ipomoea sp.). During the day the flowers were visited by three oriole species (I. waglert, I. pustulatus, and I. galbula bullocki), two hummingbird species (A. violiceps and C. sordidus), and by four species of bees. The foraging patterns of the birds are affected by the total amount of available nectar and by inter- and intraspecific agonistic interactions, whereas the foraging patterns of the bees depend on the availability of pollen. The visitors can be classified in three categories: main pollinators (bats), minor pollinators (orioles), and parasites (hummingbirds and bees). Bees play a very important negative role by reducing oriole pollination.},

Its capacity for learning and memory formation is rooted in the ecological need to efficiently collect nectar and pollen during summer to ensure survival of the hive during winter. Foraging bees learn to associate a flower's characteristic features with a reward in a way that resembles olfactory appetitive classical conditioning, a learning paradigm that is used to study mechanisms underlying learning and memory formation in the honeybee. Due to a plethora of studies on appetitive classical conditioning and phenomena related to it, the honeybee is one of the best characterized invertebrate model organisms from a learning psychological point of view. Moreover, classical conditioning and associated behavioral phenomena are surprisingly similar in honeybees and vertebrates, suggesting a convergence of underlying neuronal processes, including the molecular mechanisms that contribute to them. Here I review current thinking on the molecular mechanisms underlying long-term memory ({LTM}) formation in honeybees following classical conditioning and extinction, demonstrating that an in-depth analysis of the molecular mechanisms of classical conditioning in honeybees might add to our understanding of associative learning in honeybees and vertebrates.},

How dopamine neurons jointly encode this information, however, remains unclear. One possibility is that different neurons specialize in different aspects of prediction error; another is that each neuron calculates prediction error in the same way. We recorded from optogenetically identified dopamine neurons in the lateral ventral tegmental area ({VTA}) while mice performed classical conditioning tasks. Our tasks allowed us to determine the full prediction error functions of dopamine neurons and compare them to each other. We found marked homogeneity among individual dopamine neurons: their responses to both unexpected and expected rewards followed the same function, just scaled up or down. As a result, we were able to describe both individual and population responses using just two parameters. Such uniformity ensures robust information coding, allowing each dopamine neuron to contribute fully to the prediction error signal.},

One possibility is that apparent 'errors' in a learning task actually represent an alternative foraging strategy. In this study we investigate the potential relationship between foraging 'errors' and foraging success among bumble bee (Bombus terrestris) workers. Individual foragers were trained to choose yellow, rewarded flowers and ignore blue, unrewarded flowers. We recorded the number of errors (visits to unrewarded flowers) each bee made during training, then tested them to determine how quickly they discovered a more profitable food source (either familiar blue flowers, or novel green flowers). We found that error prone bees discovered the novel food source significantly faster than accurate bees. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the time taken to discover the novel, more profitable, food source is positively correlated with foraging success. These results suggest that foraging errors are part of an 'exploration' foraging strategy, which could be advantageous in changeable foraging environments. This could explain the observed variation in learning performance amongst foragers within social insect colonies.},

	abstract = {Behavioral ecologists have long been comfortable assuming that genetic architecture does not constrain which phenotypescan evolve (the “phenotypic gambit”). For flexible behavioral traits, however, solutions to adaptive problems are reached not only by genetic evolution but also by behavioral changes within an individual’s lifetime, via psychological mechanisms such as learning. Standard optimality approaches ignore these mechanisms, implicitly assuming that they do not constrain the expression of adaptive behavior. This assumption, which we dub the behavioral gambit, is sometimes wrong: evolved psychological mechanisms can prevent animals from behaving optimally in specific situations. To understand the functional basis of behavior, we would do better by considering the underlying mechanisms, rather than the behavioral outcomes they produce, as the target of selection. This change of focus yields new, testable predictions about evolutionary equilibria, the development of behavior, and the properties of cognitive systems. Studies on the evolution of learning rules hint at the potential insights to be gained, but such mechanism-based approaches are underexploited. We highlight three future research priorities: (1) systematic theoretical analysis of the evolutionary properties of learning rules; (2) detailed empirical study of how animals learn in nonforaging contexts;and (3) analysis of individual differences in learning rules and their associated fitness consequences.},

	abstract = {Background Most tropical and subtropical plants are biotically pollinated, and insects are the major pollinators. A small but ecologically and economically important group of plants classified in 28 orders, 67 families and about 528 species of angiosperms are pollinated by nectar-feeding bats. From a phylogenetic perspective this is a derived pollination mode involving a relatively large and energetically expensive pollinator. Here its ecological and evolutionary consequences are explored.Scope and Conclusions This review summarizes adaptations in bats and plants that facilitate this interaction and discusses the evolution of bat pollination from a plant phylogenetic perspective. Two families of bats contain specialized flower visitors, one in the Old World and one in the New World. Adaptation to pollination by bats has evolved independently many times from a variety of ancestral conditions, including insect-, bird- and non-volant mammal-pollination. Bat pollination predominates in very few families but is relatively common in certain angiosperm subfamilies and tribes. We propose that flower-visiting bats provide two important benefits to plants: they deposit large amounts of pollen and a variety of pollen genotypes on plant stigmas and, compared with many other pollinators, they are long-distance pollen dispersers. Bat pollination tends to occur in plants that occur in low densities and in lineages producing large flowers. In highly fragmented tropical habitats, nectar bats play an important role in maintaining the genetic continuity of plant populations and thus have considerable conservation value.},

In a typical cue-combination experiment, subjects estimate a value on a single dimension—for example, depth—on the basis of two different cues, such as retinal disparity and motion. The mathematics for this one-dimensional case is well established. When the variable to be estimated has two dimensions, such as location (which has both x and y values), then the one-dimensional method may be inappropriate due to possible correlations between x and y and the fact that the dimensions may be inseparable. A cue-combination task for location involves people or animals estimating xy locations under two single-cue conditions and in a condition in which both cues are combined. We present the mathematics for the two-dimensional case in an analogous manner to the one-dimensional case and illustrate them using a numeric example. Our example involves locations on maps, but the method illustrated is relevant for any task for which the estimated variable has two or more dimensions.},

	abstract = {We offer a formal treatment of choice behavior based on the premise that agents minimize the expected free energy of future outcomes. Crucially, the negative free energy or quality of a policy can be decomposed into extrinsic and epistemic (or intrinsic) value. Minimizing expected free energy is therefore equivalent to maximizing extrinsic value or expected utility (defined in terms of prior preferences or goals), while maximizing information gain or intrinsic value (or reducing uncertainty about the causes of valuable outcomes). The resulting scheme resolves the exploration-exploitation dilemma: Epistemic value is maximized until there is no further information gain, after which exploitation is assured through maximization of extrinsic value. This is formally consistent with the Infomax principle, generalizing formulations of active vision based upon salience (Bayesian surprise) and optimal decisions based on expected utility and risk-sensitive (Kullback-Leibler) control. Furthermore, as with previous active inference formulations of discrete (Markovian) problems, ad hoc softmax parameters become the expected (Bayes-optimal) precision of beliefs about, or confidence in, policies. This article focuses on the basic theory, illustrating the ideas with simulations. A key aspect of these simulations is the similarity between precision updates and dopaminergic discharges observed in conditioning paradigms.},

This function relates response probability to stimulus intensity. In estimating these response probabilities, most studies assume stationary observers: Responses are expected to be dependent only on the intensity of a presented stimulus and not on other factors such as stimulus sequence, duration of the experiment, or the responses on previous trials. Unfortunately, a number of factors such as learning, fatigue, or fluctuations in attention and motivation will typically result in violations of this assumption. The severity of these violations is yet unknown. We use Monte Carlo simulations to show that violations of these assumptions can result in underestimation of confidence intervals for parameters of the psychometric function. Even worse, collecting more trials does not eliminate this misestimation of confidence intervals. We present a simple adjustment of the confidence intervals that corrects for the underestimation almost independently of the number of trials and the particular type of violation.},

The parameters that varied between the feeders were the amount and variance of reward. The four feeders were arranged in two pairs, with the two feeders in each pair set to the same reward parameters. Constant feeders offered a fixed amount of sucrose solution at each bee visit; variable feeders offered a normally distributed reward with a standard deviation equal to the mean. We tested three reward combinations under two variance conditions. The bees matched their choice frequencies to the mean amount of reward. This applied both to the constant and the variable feeders. Thus the bees were able to discriminate feeders by the amount of reward and were able to estimate the mean reward for the variable flowers. The proportion of immediate returns to the same feeder increased with the amount of sucrose solution imbibed at each visit, indicating that bees were able to perceive the amount of reward at each visit. However, there was no influence of variance on the choice behaviour of the bees, ruling out the possibility that bees are risk sensitive under these conditions.

• Methods Pollinators were recorded in natural populations. The morpho-anatomical study was carried out through scanning electron and light microscopy. Nectar sugars were identified via gas chromatography. Nectar production and the effect of its removal on total nectar sugar amount were determined by using sets of bagged flowers.
• Key Results Hymenopterans were visitors of most species, while hummingbirds visited I. rubriflora and sphingids I. alba. All the species had a vascularized discoidal nectary surrounding the ovary base with numerous open stomata with a species-specific distribution. All nectar samples contained amino acids and sugars. Most species had sucrose-dominant nectars. Flowers lasted a few hours. Mean nectar sugar concentration throughout the lifetime of the flower ranged from 34·28 to 39·42 \%, except for I. cairica (49·25 \%) and I. rubriflora (25·18 \%). Ipomoea alba had the highest nectar volume secreted per flower (50·12 µL), while in the other taxa it ranged from 2·42 to 12·00 µL. Nectar secretion began as soon as the flowers opened and lasted for a few hours (in I. purpurea, I. rubriflora) or it was continuous during the lifetime of the flower (in the remaining species). There was an increase of total sugar production after removals in I. cairica, I. indica and I. purpurea, whereas in I. alba and I. rubriflora removals had no effect, and in I. hieronymi there was a decrease in total sugar production.
• Conclusions The chemical composition, production dynamics and removal effects of nectar could not be related to the pollinator guild of these species. Flower length was correlated with nectary size and total volume of nectar secreted, suggesting that structural constraints may play a major role in the determination of nectar traits of these species.},

However, much learning is rapid and does not depend on temporal contiguity, which has never been precisely defined. These points are well illustrated by studies showing that the temporal relations between events are rapidly learned- even over long delays- and that this knowledge governs the form and timing of behavior. The speed with which anticipatory responses emerge in conditioning paradigms is determined by the information that cues provide about the timing of rewards. The challenge for understanding the neurobiology of learning is to understand the mechanisms in the nervous system that encode information from even a single experience, the nature of the memory mechanisms that can encode quantities such as time, and how the brain can flexibly perform computations based on this information.},

The learning curves for individual subjects show an abrupt, often step-like increase from the untrained level of responding to the level seen in the well trained subject. The rise is at least as abrupt as that commonly seen in psychometric functions in stimulus detection experiments. It may indicate that the appearance of conditioned behavior is mediated by an evidence-based decision process, as in stimulus detection experiments. If the appearance of conditioned behavior is taken instead to reflect the increase in an underlying associative strength, then a negligible portion of the function relating associative strength to amount of experience is behaviorally visible. Consequently, rate of learning cannot be estimated from the group-average curve; the best measure is latency to the onset of responding, determined for each subject individually.},

This and other features of the adjustments to frequent changes imply that the behavioral effect of reinforcement depends on the subject's perception of incomes and changes in incomes rather than on the strengthening and weakening of behaviors in accord with their past effects or expected results.

With pulse duration held constant, the required strength of the train (the charge delivered per second) was a hyperbolic function of train duration, with chronaxie C approximately 500 msec. To a first approximation, the values of c and C were independent of the choice either of train duration and pulse frequency or of pulse duration, respectively. Hence, the current intensity required by any choice of train duration, pulse frequency, and pulse duration dependent on only two basic parameters, c and C, and one quantity, Qi, the required impulse charge.

	abstract = {Behavioral syndromes predict that individuals display behaviors consistently across different ecological situations, resulting in correlations among functionally different individual-specific behaviors (e.g., activity, exploration, aggression, and risk taking). Such consistencies can arise because of the common innate government of traits (i.e., temperament). However, different behaviors can be mediated by different selection regimes and/or measured with different errors. Furthermore, contextual overlap among traits may also vary. These possibilities can cause dissimilarities in the pair-wise relationship between particular traits. To determine the relationships among the most studied behaviors, we performed a modern meta-analysis, in which we assessed the strength of correlations in each possible combination of traits. Relying on data from 81 scientific papers, we found that the correlations among behaviors were generally weak and that they varied in magnitude across comparisons (e.g., novel environment exploration and activity: r = 0.345; novel object exploration and activity: r = 0.074). The partial correlations among traits revealed that certain relationships (e.g., novel environment exploration/activity and the novel object exploration/risk taking) were independent of the covariation with other traits, whereas certain relationships (e.g., aggression/novel environment exploration) consistently weakened after controlling for covariance. Some relationships were affected by contextual overlap: the effect sizes were systematically higher when the behaviors were assayed in the same experimental compartment (e.g., same test room or aquarium). Different correlations are unlikely to emerge due to differences in repeatabilities that are associated with the measurement of different traits, as we found that averaged repeatabilities vary around the same intermediate magnitude for each behavior. We suggest that the most commonly assessed behavioral traits do not necessarily form equally independent domains.},

In this study, we expose computer-generated plant populations with a wide variation in flower color to selection by live and virtual hummingbirds and bumblebees and track evolutionary changes in flower color over multiple generations. Flower color, which was derived from the known genetic architecture and phenotypic variance of naturally occurring plant species pollinated by both groups, evolved in simulations through a genetic algorithm in which pollinator preference determined changes in flower color between generations. The observed preferences of live hummingbirds and bumblebees were strong enough to cause adaptive divergence in flower color between plant populations but did not lead to ethological isolation. However, stronger preferences assigned to virtual pollinators in sympatric and allopatric scenarios rapidly produced ethological isolation. Pollinators can thus drive ecological speciation in flowering plants, but more rigorous and comprehensive behavioral studies are required to specify conditions that produce sufficient preference levels in pollinators.},

	abstract = {Parasitic infection can influence a variety of behavioural mechanisms in animals, but little is known about the effects of infection on the cognitive processes underlying ecologically relevant behaviours. Here, we examined whether parasitic infection alters cognitive aspects of foraging in a social insect, the bumble-bee (Bombus impatiens). In controlled experiments, we assessed the ability of foraging bees to discriminate rewarding from non-rewarding flowers on the basis of colour and odour. We found that natural and experimental infection by a protozoan parasite (Crithidia bombi, which lives exclusively within the gut tract), impaired the ability of foragers to learn the colour of rewarding flowers. Parasitic infection can thus disrupt central nervous system pathways that mediate cognitive processes in bumble-bees and as a consequence, can reduce their ability to monitor floral resources and make economic foraging decisions. It is postulated that this infection-induced change to cognitive function in bumble-bees is the result of communication between immune and nervous systems. Parasitized animals, including invertebrates, can therefore show subtle behavioural changes that are nonetheless ecologically significant and reflect complex mechanisms.},

We define intelligence operationally as the ability to disregard unrewarding behavior sequences, without trying them out, in the search for rewarding sequences. We show that increasing a species’ behavioral repertoire increases the number of rewarding behavior sequences that can be performed, but also the time required to learn such sequences. This trade-off results in an optimal repertoire size that decreases rapidly with increasing sequence length. Behavioral repertoire size can be increased by increasing intelligence or lengthening the lifespan, giving rise to the observed correlations between these traits.},

	abstract = {Heuristics are efficient cognitive processes that ignore information. In contrast to the widely held view that less processing reduces accuracy, the study of heuristics shows that less information, computation, and time can in fact improve accuracy. We review the major progress made so far: (a) the discovery of less-is-more effects; (b) the study of the ecological rationality of heuristics, which examines in which environments a given strategy succeeds or fails, and why; (c) an advancement from vague labels to computational models of heuristics; (d) the development of a systematic theory of heuristics that identifies their building blocks and the evolved capacities they exploit, and views the cognitive system as relying on an “adaptive toolbox;” and (e) the development of an empirical methodology that accounts for individual differences, conducts competitive tests, and has provided evidence for people’s adaptive use of heuristics. Homo heuristicus has a biased mind and ignores part of the available information, yet a biased mind can handle uncertainty more efficiently and robustly than an unbiased mind relying on more resource-intensive and general-purpose processing strategies.},

	abstract = {The aim of this study was to test whether honeybees develop reward expectations. In our experiment, bees first learned to associate colors with a sugar reward in a setting closely resembling a natural foraging situation. We then evaluated whether and how the sequence of the animals’ experiences with different reward magnitudes changed their later behavior in the absence of reinforcement and within an otherwise similar context. We found that the bees that had experienced increasing reward magnitudes during training assigned more time to flower inspection 24 and 48 h after training. Our design and behavioral measurements allowed us to uncouple the signal learning and the nutritional aspects of foraging from the effects of subjective reward values. We thus found that the animals behaved differently neither because they had more strongly associated the related predicting signals nor because they were fed more or faster. Our results document for the first time that honeybees develop long-term expectations of reward; these expectations can guide their foraging behavior after a relatively long pause and in the absence of reinforcement, and further experiments will aim toward an elucidation of the neural mechanisms involved in this form of learning.},

	abstract = {Most animal-pollinated plants produce nectar as a pollinator reward. Despite the main role that nectar plays in plant-pollinator interactions, the impact of natural variation in nectar traits on realized male fitness is poorly known. Here, we assessed this relation for a wild Petunia axillaris population using paternity-based direct selection gradient analysis, which allowed us also to infer pollen dispersal patterns. Because male fecundity may depend on other traits which could be associated with nectar characteristics (i.e. volume and concentration), we also considered selection on other key reproductive traits. The analysis revealed that P. axillaris was a strict outcrosser, but that successful pollination occurred mainly among neighbours. Individual plants varied greatly in their male fecundity. Nectar concentration, a key feature of nectar that determines its profitability, was subjected to stabilizing selection. Selection through male function also affected corolla area (positive directional selection), corolla tube length (negative directional selection), and floral display size (stabilizing selection), but none of these traits were phenotypically correlated with nectar characteristics. Because nectar concentration affects the ability and foraging efficiency of different flower visitors to feed on nectar, stabilizing selection may reflect either the preference of the most effective pollinators, or antagonistic selection driven by pollinators and non-pollinating nectar consumers.},

These synaptic modifications, in turn, provide the mechanistic underpinning for a specific class of reinforcement learning mechanisms that now seem to underlie much of human and animal behavior. This review describes both the critical empirical findings that are at the root of this conclusion and the fantastic theoretical advances from which this conclusion is drawn.},

We reviewed the chemical composition of both {FNs} and {EFNs} and found that nectar composition appears tailored to fulfil these ambivalent roles. Carbohydrates and amino acids usually function in the attraction of mutualists and appear adapted to the physiological needs of the respective mutualists. Volatiles are a further group of compounds that serves in the attractive function of nectars. By contrast, secondary compounds such as alkaloids and phenols serve the protection from nectar robbers, and most nectar proteins that have been characterised to date protect {FN} and {EFN} from microbial infestation.

Arguments for and against cross-species comparisons are discussed, and research guidelines are suggested. Finally, a research agenda guided by evolutionary and ecological principles is proposed.

	abstract = {Animal personality, defined as consistent individual differences across context and time, has attracted much recent research interest in the study of animal behaviour. More recently, this field has begun to examine how such variation arose and is maintained within populations. The habitat-dependent selection hypothesis, which posits that animals with differing personality types may fare better (i.e. have a fitness advantage) in different habitats, suggests one possible mechanism. In the current experiment, we tested whether slow- and fast-exploring black-capped chickadees (Poecile atricapillus), determined by performance in a novel environment exploration task, perform differentially when the demands of an acoustic operant discrimination (cognitive) task were altered following successful task acquisition. We found that slow-exploring birds learn to reverse previously learned natural category rules more quickly than faster exploring conspecifics. In accordance with the habitat-dependent selection hypothesis, and previous work with great tits (Parus major), a close relative of the black-capped chickadee, our results suggest that fast-exploring birds may perform better in stable, predictable environments where forming a routine is advantageous, while slow-exploring birds are favoured in unstable, unpredictable environments, where task demands often change. Our results also support a hypothesis derived from previous work with great tits; slow-exploring birds may be generally more flexible (i.e. able to modify their behaviour in accordance with changes in environmental stimuli) in some learning tasks.},

	abstract = {Basic understanding of the fundamental principles and mechanisms involved in learning is lacking for elasmobranch fishes. Our aim in this study was to experimentally investigate the learning and memory capacity of juvenile Port Jackson sharks, Heterodontus portusjacksoni. Sharks (N = 30) were conditioned over a 19-day period to associate an underwater {LED} light or stream of air-bubbles [conditioned stimulus ({CS})] with a food reward [unconditioned stimulus ({US})], using three procedures (delay, trace and control). During experiments, the {CS} signalled at a random time between 180 and 300 s for 30 s (six times per day). For the delay the {US} overlapped in time with the {CS}, for the trace the {US} delivered 10 s after the {CS} and for our control the {US} was delivered at random time between 180 and 300 s after the {CS}. H. portusjacksoni sharks trained in all procedures improved consistently in their time to obtain food, indicative of Pavlovian learning. Importantly, the number of sharks in the feeding area 5 s prior to {CS} onset did not change over time for any procedures. However, significantly more sharks were present 5 s after {CS} onset for delay for both air-bubble and light {CS}. Sharks trained in the delay and trace procedures using air-bubbles as the {CS} also displayed significantly more anticipatory behaviours, such as turning towards the {CS} and biting. Sharks trained with the light {CS} did not exhibit such behaviours; however, trace procedural sharks did show a significant improvement in moving towards the {CS} at its onset. At 20 and 40 days after the end of the conditioning experiments, some sharks were presented the {CS} without reward. Two sharks trained in the delay procedure using air-bubbles as the {CS} exhibited biting behaviours: one at 20 and the other at 40 days. This study demonstrates that H. portusjacksoni have the capacity to learn a classical conditioning procedure relatively quickly (30 trials during 5 days) and associate two time-separated events and retention of learnt associations for at least 24 h and possibly up to 40 days.},

	doi = {10.1086/648604},
	abstract = {Best linear unbiased prediction ({BLUP}) is a method for obtaining point estimates of a random effect in a mixed effect model. Over the past decade it has been used extensively in ecology and evolutionary biology to predict individual breeding values and reaction norms. These predictions have been used to infer natural selection, evolutionary change, spatial-genetic patterns, individual reaction norms, and frailties. In this article we show analytically and through simulation and example why {BLUP} often gives anticonservative and biased estimates of evolutionary and ecological parameters. Although some concerns with {BLUP} methodology have been voiced before, the scale and breadth of the problems have probably not been widely appreciated. Bias arises because {BLUPs} are often used to estimate effects that are not explicitly accounted for in the model used to make the predictions. In these cases, predicted breeding values will often say more about phenotypic patterns than the genetic patterns of interest. An additional problem is that {BLUPs} are point estimates of quantities that are usually known with little certainty. Failure to account for this uncertainty in subsequent tests can lead to both bias and extreme anticonservatism. We demonstrate that restricted maximum likelihood and Bayesian solutions exist for these problems and show how unbiased and powerful tests can be derived that adequately quantify uncertainty. Of particular utility is a new test for detecting evolutionary change that not only accounts for prediction error in breeding values but also accounts for drift. To illustrate the problem, we apply these tests to long-term data on the Soay sheep (Ovis aries) and the great tit (Parus major) and show that previously reported temporal trends in breeding values are not supported.},

We then apply the extended model to a food choice context. The model produces a variety of individual behaviors and population-level patterns which are not evident from the traditional formulation, but which offer potential insights for understanding food reward learning and obesity. These include a "lock-in" effect, through which early exposure can strongly shape later reward valuation. We discuss potential implications of our results for the study and prevention of obesity, for the reward learning field, and for future experimental and computational work.},

Access time increases linearly with flower depth, but ingestion time varies with flower depth only in flowers deeper than the length of the bee's glossa, due to a decline in the rate of ingestion of nectar. Probing time therefore increases gradually with increasing depth for flowers shallower than the bee's glossa, but beyond that depth it increases much more rapidly.

Two types of selectivity were observed in four of thirteen groups of ten to fifteen bees: a preference for larger than average flowers when all flowers of a particular species were shallower than the lengths of the bees' glossae (= tongues); or a positive correlation between glossa length and the depth of flowers visited when glossa length approximately equalled flower depth. To explain these results an energetic model was developed based jointly on the dependence of a bee's probing time on glossa length and flower depth, and a positive correlation between flower depth and nectar production. This model was tested by an experiment with different-sized artificial flowers which contained volumes of sugar solution in direct relation to flower size. Because all flowers were shallower than the glossa lengths of the tested bees, a preference for the largest flowers was expected. Over a series of trials three of four bees fed in the expected pattern. Selective behaviour was reflected in very different patterns of size-related flower visitation, which depended on the particular characteristics of both bees and flowers.},

In experiment 1 we attempted to determine whether birds were able to differentiate between flowers of the same type that they had emptied, flowers they had seen but not visited and new flowers. They were tested with three trial types, all of which involved birds visiting four rewarded flowers in the first phase of a trial. In ‘free’ trials, the bird was allowed to choose four from eight flowers. In ‘forced’ trials there were only four flowers available in phase 1 and in ‘mixed’ trials the bird could choose four from six available flowers. In all trial types eight flowers (including all those in the same locations as in phase 1) were presented to the bird on its return in phase 2. The four rewarded flowers were those not visited in phase 1. In free and mixed trials, birds were better than chance at avoiding the flowers they had emptied in phase 1. In mixed trials, birds were more likely to visit the new flowers that were unique to phase 2. In experiment 2 we tested whether flower height was a floral feature remembered by birds. Birds were given forced and free trials in which the flowers in the radial maze were presented at two heights. As performance in both trial types was better than chance we suggest that hummingbirds use flower height to remember the locations of flowers.},

	abstract = {A major goal of ecology is to discover how dynamics and structure of multi-trophic ecological communities are related. This is difficult, because whole-community data are limited and typically comprise only a snapshot of a community instead of a time series of dynamics, and mathematical models of complex system dynamics have a large number of unmeasured parameters and therefore have been only tenuously related to real systems. These are related problems, because long time-series, if they were commonly available, would enable inference of parameters. The resulting ‘plague of parameters’ means most studies of multi-species population dynamics have been very theoretical. Dynamical models parametrized using physiological allometries may offer a partial cure for the plague of parameters, and these models are increasingly used in theoretical studies. However, physiological allometries cannot determine all parameters, and the models have also rarely been directly tested against data. We confronted a model of community dynamics with data from a lake community. Many important empirical patterns were reproducible as outcomes of dynamics, and were not reproducible when parameters did not follow physiological allometries. Results validate the usefulness, when parameters follow physiological allometries, of classic differential-equation models for understanding whole-community dynamics and the structure–dynamics relationship.},

In simple reinforcement learning algorithms, value functions are updated only by trial-and-error, whereas they are updated according to the decision-maker's knowledge or model of the environment in model-based reinforcement learning algorithms. To investigate how animals update value functions, we trained rats under two different free-choice tasks. The reward probability of the unchosen target remained unchanged in one task, whereas it increased over time since the target was last chosen in the other task. The results show that goal choice probability increased as a function of the number of consecutive alternative choices in the latter, but not the former task, indicating that the animals were aware of time-dependent increases in arming probability and used this information in choosing goals. In addition, the choice behavior in the latter task was better accounted for by a model-based reinforcement learning algorithm. Our results show that rats adopt a decision-making process that cannot be accounted for by simple reinforcement learning models even in a relatively simple binary choice task, suggesting that rats can readily improve their decision-making strategy through the knowledge of their environments.},

In trinary comparisons, subjects preferred the low-variance reward over the constant reward, and the constant reward over the high-variance reward; a result not predicted by risk-sensitive foraging theory. However, when tested with traditional binary comparisons, hummingbirds showed conventional risk-averse behaviour and selected the constant reward over the low- or high-variance rewards. This reversal of preference represents a context-dependent foraging preference.

Similarity of floral cues between co-flowering species influences how rapidly pollinators learn to avoid deceptive plants. This learning process, which affects the reproductive success of deceptive plants, may additionally depend on relative timing of flowering of sympatric rewarding and deceptive species. We tested the combined effects of corolla colour similarity and flowering order of rewarding and deceptive artificial inflorescences on visitation by naïve bumblebees. When deceptive inflorescences were offered after rewarding inflorescences, bumblebees visited them four times more often if both species were similar compared with when they were dissimilar. Pollinator visitation rate to deceptive inflorescences offered before rewarding inflorescences was intermediate and independent of similarity. Thus, early-flowering deceptive species avoid the costs of dissimilarity with rewarding species. This mechanism may favour adaptive evolution of flowering phenology in deceptive species and explain why temperate deceptive orchids usually flower earlier than rewarding ones.},

	abstract = {Pollinators often sequentially visit 1 flower type while bypassing other equally rewarding flower types, behavior known as flower constancy. One explanation for flower constancy is that pollinators use the search image of a specific flower type to efficiently find flowers because they are often cryptic. The so-called search image hypothesis predicts that temporal specialization to 1 flower type by an individual pollinator declines as flower conspicuousness increases because if flowers are conspicuous, pollinators can divide their attention among different flower types. To test this prediction, we investigated visitation sequences of individual bumble bees (Bombus ignitus) to a patch of blue and yellow artificial flowers. We used different flower sizes and interflower distances as independent determinants of flower visual size and noisiness of the background and, thus, of flower crypsis. Flower color selectivity and flower search time decreased and subsequently increased with visual size of the nearest flowers, with a minimum of approximately 15° of the visual angle. Within-bout constancy, measured as the tendency of flying to the same flower types in succession compared with the expectation of a given flower selectivity within a bout, increased with visual size of the nearest flowers. Flower selectivity and within-bout constancy did not differ among arrays that shared the same floral visual angle, indicating that visual size, rather than flight distance or flower size itself, had a substantial effect on flower choices. Our results suggest that flower visual size and background noisiness affect flower crypsis and constancy, providing support for the search image hypothesis.},

With the availability of a wealth of new data on basal metabolic rate ({BMR}) and brain size and with the aid of reliable techniques of comparative analysis, we are able to show that in fact energetics is an issue in the maintenance of a relatively large brain, and that brain size is positively correlated with the {BMR} in mammals, controlling for body size effects. We conclude that attempts to explain brain size variation in different taxa must consider the ability to sustain the energy costs alongside cognitive benefits.},

	abstract = {The expensive brain hypothesis predicts an interspecific link between relative brain size and life-history pace. Indeed, animals with relatively large brains have reduced rates of growth and reproduction. However, they also have increased total lifespan. Here we show that the reduction in production with increasing brain size is not fully compensated by the increase in lifespan. Consequently, the maximum rate of population increase (rmax) is negatively correlated with brain mass. This result is not due to a confounding effect of body size, indicating that the well-known correlation between rmax and body size is driven by brain size, at least among homeothermic vertebrates. Thus, each lineage faces a ‘grey ceiling’, i.e. a maximum viable brain size, beyond which rmax is so low that the risk of local or species extinction is very high. We found that the steep decline in rmax with brain size is absent in taxa with allomaternal offspring provisioning, such as cooperatively breeding mammals and most altricial birds. These taxa thus do not face a lineage-specific grey ceiling, which explains the far greater number of independent origins of large brain size in birds than mammals. We also predict that (absolute and relative) brain size is an important predictor of macroevolutionary extinction patterns.},

That “Principle” has been roundly criticized [Luce, R. D., \&amp; Edwards, W. (1958). The derivation of subjective scales from just noticeable differences. Psychological Review, 65, 227–237] as being inconsistent with the very basis of Fechner's psychophysical theory, and indeed this is the case. In important papers Pfanzagl [(1962). Über die stochastische Fundierung des psychophysischen Gesetzes (On the stochastic foundations of the psychophysical law). Biometrische Zeitschrift, 4, 1–14] and Krantz [(1971). Integration of just noticeable differences. Journal of Mathematical Psychology, 8, 591–599] resurrected Fechner's method; their analysis showed that the sensory scale could be written as the limit of a sequence of integrals, each of the form suggested by the auxiliary principle. In this work, we investigate the properties of a typical member of the Krantz–Pfanzagl sequence of integrals; we do so with the view to obtaining useful approximations to the true scale. Weber's inequality [Falmagne, J.-Cl. (1977). Note: Weber's inequality and Fechner's problem. Journal of Mathematical Psychology, 16, 267–271] plays an important role in our developments. That inequality, and other inequalities of a similar nature, allows us to place bounds on the error incurred by approximating a true scale u by an integral u {\textasciicircum} of jnds. Under appropriate conditions these bounds are sufficiently tight that the relative error ( u - u {\textasciicircum} ) / u is very small over the entire stimulus domain. We illustrate our theoretical results with a number of examples.},

Intensity discrimination as a function of frequency and sensation level. Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, A, 61, 169–177], within the framework of Fechner's Psychophysics. To this end, we introduce a pair of Psychophysical Laws governing the behavior of Weber sensitivities. One of these, the Power Law, embodies ideas that Jesteadt et al. introduced in their original discussion of the near-miss phenomenon. Falmagne's Law captures ideas of Falmagne and colleagues [Falmagne, J.-Cl. (1985). Elements of psychophysical theory. New York: Oxford University Press; Doble, C., Falmagne, J.-Cl., \&amp; Berg, B.G. (2003). Theoretical note: Recasting (the near-miss to) Weber's Law. Psychological Review, 110, 365–375]. These two laws, which account for the near-miss phenomenon in quite different ways, are shown to be special cases of a more general Psychophysical Law of Similarity. We find all (smooth) solutions of this Law of Similarity that are compatible with Fechnerian psychophysics. Of the 11 solutions, four are relevant to the near-miss phenomenon; two of these solutions reproduce the models of Jesteadt et al. and Doble et al. and the other two solutions each provide a new accounting of the near-miss phenomenon. We discuss the possibility of distinguishing among these four models in empirical data.},

	abstract = {The tendency for some individuals to partake in high-risk behaviors (eg, substance abuse, gambling, risky sexual activities) is a matter of great public health concern, yet the characteristics and neural bases of this vulnerability are largely unknown. Recent work shows that this susceptibility can be partially predicted by laboratory measures of reward seeking under risk, including the Balloon Analog Risk Task. Rats were trained to respond on two levers: one of which (the ‘add lever’) increased the size of a potential food reward and a second (the ‘cash-out lever’) that led to delivery of accrued reward. Crucially, each add-lever response was also associated with a risk that the trial would fail and no reward would be delivered. The relative probabilities that each add-lever press would lead to an addition food pellet or to trial failure (risk) were orthogonally varied. Rats exhibited a pattern of responding characteristic of incentive motivation and risk aversion, with a subset of rats showing traits of high-risk taking and/or suboptimal responding. Neural inactivation studies suggest that the orbitofrontal cortex supports greater reward seeking in the presence or absence of risk, whereas the medial prefrontal cortex is required for optimization of patterns of responding. These findings provide new information about the neural circuitry of decision making under risk and reveal new insights into the biological determinants of risk-taking behaviors that may be useful in developing biomarkers of vulnerability.},

Normative theories focus on how to make the best decisions by deriving algebraic representations of preference from idealized behavioral axioms. Descriptive theories adopt this algebraic representation, but incorporate known limitations of human behavior. Computational approaches start from a different set of assumptions altogether, focusing instead on the underlying cognitive and emotional processes that result in the selection of one option over the other. This review comprehensively but concisely describes and contrasts three approaches in terms of their theoretical assumptions and their ability to account for behavioral and neurophysiological evidence from experimental research. Although each approach contributes substantially to our understanding of human decision making, we argue that the computational approach is more fruitful and parsimonious for describing and predicting choices in both laboratory and applied settings and for understanding the neurophysiological substrates of decision making.

	abstract = {It has been suggested that the absence of floral rewards in many orchid species causes pollinators to probe fewer flowers on a plant, and thus reduces geitonogamy, i.e. self-pollination between flowers, which may result in inbreeding depression and reduced pollen export. We examined the effects of nectar addition on pollinator visitation and pollen transfer by tracking the fate of colour-labelled pollen in Anacamptis morio, a non-rewarding orchid species pollinated primarily by queen bumble-bees. Addition of nectar to spurs of A. morio significantly increased the number of flowers probed by bumble-bees, the time spent on an inflorescence, pollinarium removal and the proportion of removed pollen involved in self-pollination through geitonogamy, but did not affect pollen carryover (the fraction of a pollinarium carried over from one flower to the next). Only visits that exceeded 18 s resulted in geitonogamy, as this is the time taken for removed pollinaria to bend into a position to strike the stigma. A mutation for nectar production in A. morio would result in an initial 3.8-fold increase in pollinarium removal per visit, but also increase geitonogamous self-pollination from less than 10\% of pollen depositions to ca. 40\%. Greater efficiency of pollen export will favour deceptive plants when pollinators are relatively common and most pollinaria are removed from flowers or when inbreeding depression is severe. These findings provide empirical support both for Darwin's contention that pollinarium bending is an anti-selfing mechanism in orchids and for the idea that floral deception serves to maximize the efficiency of pollen export.},

To determine the effects of both factors on the feeding behavior of the hovering hawk moth Macroglossum stellatarum, we developed a method to independently manipulate sucrose concentrations and viscosity. The intake rate was analyzed as a function of sucrose concentration, the concentration at constant viscosity (kept constant by adding tylose, an inert polysaccharide), and of the different viscosities of a 30\% weight/weight (w/w) sucrose solution (by adding different amounts of tylose). By increasing the concentration, and thus its viscosity, the solution intake rate (in microl s (-1)) decreased beyond a 20\% w/w sucrose solution. For a 30\% sucrose solution, the intake rate decreased with increasing viscosity. At constant viscosity, the solution intake rate decreased beyond a 30\% w/w sucrose solution. However, if we considered the quantity of sucrose ingested per unit time (sucrose intake rate), the same fitted maximum was attained for both series in which the sucrose concentration changed (33.6\% w/w). Results suggest that the gustatory input affects the dynamics of fluid ingestion separately from the viscosity.},

Monkeys viewed images of two different foods and learned that they would receive a piece of the one they touched first. After demonstrating that they would reliably select images of their preferred foods on one set of foods, animals were transferred to images of a second set of familiar foods. We assumed that if the monkeys recognized the images, they would spontaneously select images of their preferred foods on the second set of foods. Three monkeys selected images of their preferred foods significantly more often than chance on their first transfer session. In an additional test of the monkeys’ picture recognition abilities, animals were presented with pairs of food images containing a medium-preference food paired with either a high-preference food or a low-preference food. The same three monkeys selected the medium-preference foods significantly more often when they were paired with low-preference foods and significantly less often when those same foods were paired with high-preference foods. Our novel design provided convincing evidence that macaques recognized the content of two-dimensional images on a touch screen.

	abstract = {This paper concerns the response of foraging animals to variability in rate of gain, or risk. Both the empirical and theoretical literatures relevant to this issue are reviewed. The methodology and results from fifty-nine studies in which animals are required to choose between foraging options differing in the variances in the rate of gain available are tabulated. We found that when risk is generated by variability in the amount of reward, animals are most frequently risk-averse and sometimes indifferent to risk, although in some studies preference depends on energy budget. In contrast, when variability is in delay to reward, animals are universally risk-prone. A range of functional, descriptive and mechanistic accounts for these findings is described, none of which alone is capable of accommodating all aspects of the data. Risk-sensitive foraging theory provides the only currently available explanation for why energy budget should affect preference. An information-processing model that incorporates Weber's law provides the only general explanation for why animals should be risk-averse with variability in amount and risk-prone with delay. A theory based on the mechanisms of associative learning explains quantitative aspects of risk-proneness for delay; specifically why the delay between choice and reward should have a stronger impact on preference than delays between the reward and subsequent choice. It also explains why animals should appear to commit the “fallacy of the average,” maximising the expected ratio of amount of reward over delay to reward when computing rates rather than the ratio of expected amount over expected delay. We conclude that only a fusion of functional and mechanistic thinking will lead to progress in the understanding of animal decision making.},

Choices among risky prospects exhibit several pervasive effects that are inconsistent with the basic tenets of utility theory. In particular, people underweight outcomes that are merely probable in comparison with outcomes that are obtained with certainty. This tendency, called the certainty effect, contributes to risk aversion in choices involving sure gains and to risk seeking in choices involving sure losses. In addition, people generally discard components that are shared by all prospects under consideration. This tendency, called the isolation effect, leads to inconsistent preferences when the same choice is presented in different forms. An alternative theory of choice is developed, in which value is assigned to gains and losses rather than to final assets and in which probabilities are replaced by decision weights. The value function is normally concave for gains, commonly convex for losses, and is generally steeper for losses than for gains. Decision weights are generally lower than the corresponding probabilities, except in the range of low probabilities. Overweighting of low probabilities may contribute to the attractiveness of both insurance and gambling.},

	abstract = {Different cognitive processes underlying voice identity perception in humans may have precursors in mammals. A perception of vocal signatures may govern individualised interactions in bats, which comprise species living in complex social structures and are nocturnal, fast-moving mammals. This paper investigates to what extent bats recognise, and discriminate between, individual voices and discusses acoustic features relevant for accomplishing these tasks. In spontaneous presentation and habituation–dishabituation experiments, we investigated how Megaderma lyra perceives and evaluates stimuli consisting of contact call series with individual-specific signatures from either social partners or unknown individuals. Spontaneous presentations of contact call stimuli from social partners or unknown individuals elicited strong, but comparable reactions. In the habituation–dishabituation experiments, bats dishabituated significantly to any new stimulus. However, reactions were less pronounced to a novel stimulus from the bat used for habituation than to stimuli from other bats, irrespective of familiarity, which provides evidence for identity discrimination. A model separately assessing the dissimilarity of stimuli in syllable frequencies, syllable durations and inter-call intervals relative to learned memory templates accounted for the behaviour of the bats. With respect to identity recognition, the spontaneous presentation experiments were not conclusive. However, the habituation–dishabituation experiments suggested that the bats recognised voices of social partners as the reaction to a re-habituation stimulus differed after a dishabituation stimulus from a social partner and an unknown bat.},

	abstract = {Simple heuristics, such as deterministic elimination by aspects ({DEBA}) and equal weighting of attributes with {DEBA} as a tiebreaker ({EW}/{DEBA}), have been found to perform curiously well in choosing one out of many alternatives based on a few binary attributes. {DEBA} and {EW}/{DEBA} sometimes achieve near-perfect performance and complement each other (if one is wrong or does not apply, the other is correct). Here, these findings are confirmed and extended; most importantly, a theory is presented that explains them. The theory allows calculating the performance of any model, for any number of binary attributes, for any preferences of the decision maker, for all sizes of the consideration set, and for sampling alternatives with as well as without replacement. Calculations based on the theory organize previous empirical findings and provide new surprising results. For example, the performance of both {DEBA} and {EW}/{DEBA} is a U-shaped function of the size of the consideration set and converges relatively quickly to perfection as the size of the consideration set increases (this result holds even when the preferences of the decision maker are worst-case scenarios for the performance of the heuristics). An explanation for why {DEBA} and {EW}/{DEBA} complement each other is also provided. Finally, the need for a unified theory of multiattribute choice and cue-based judgment is discussed.},

After an introduction which discusses the types of information sought in pollination studies, there are 4 chapters describing techniques applicable to plants and flowers. These include collecting, preserving and marking, preventing visits from pollinators, morphological measurements, analysis of floral fragrance and colour, pollen identification, pollen collection, pollen germination tests, staining techniques for pollen tubes, techniques for studying pollen dispersal (particularly by insects), measurement of nectar volumes and secretion, analysis of nectar contents and properties, and techniques for other floral rewards such as oils and resins. Chapter 6, on mating systems, describes tests for self-pollination and self-incompatibility, analysis of reproductive success, determining pollinator efficiency, and studies of resource limitation of seed production. Chapter 7 describes techniques for studying animal pollinators, including insects, birds, bats and mammals. The methods for studying insects give details of collecting devices, traps, preserving and identifying specimens, collecting pollen from insects and their nests, and morphological measurements; there is a detailed section on studies of foraging behaviour. Techniques for estimating pollinator populations and keeping pollinators in captivity are also given. Chapter 8 describes techniques for environmental measurements e.g. temperature, humidity, wind speed. The final chapter is concerned with experimental considerations. The 5 appendixes give references to the pollen literature, sources of equipment, chemicals and stains, computer programs, and a glossary. The 67-page bibliography gives 1223 references and there are indexes to subjects, plants, animals and chemicals.},

	abstract = {Foraging bumblebees focus mainly on one flower species (their ‘major’), and occasionally visit other flowers (‘minors’) that are less rewarding. Minoring allows tracking of potential alternative resources that might become more profitable with time. This is expected to provide an adaptive benefit under unstable foraging conditions, but to reduce foraging efficiency when resources are steady. We tested how predictability of food sources affects minoring and foraging success, using Bombus terrestris workers that fed on sucrose solution in artificial flowers. Bees exposed to three colour-distinct flower types with fluctuating food rewards performed more minoring (visits to a fourth, nonrewarding flower type) than bees that encountered a stable reward schedule. This difference was mostly due to a higher frequency of flower type shifts in the fluctuating-reward treatment. Flowers of the highest-rewarding type were visited less frequently in the fluctuating-reward than in the stable-reward treatment. This suggests that the fluctuating-reward schedule limited the bees' ability to track the most profitable flower type. Intervals between successive visits were longer in the fluctuating-reward than in the stable-reward treatment, possibly because the fluctuating schedule required time-consuming neural processing. As expected, the number of minoring visits correlated negatively with the number of colour shifts and with foraging success in the stable-reward treatment. In the fluctuating-reward treatment, on the other hand, sucrose intake rates were independent of minoring and colour shift frequencies. We suggest that novelty seeking by foragers can evolve when food sources offer fluctuating rewards, which reduce foraging success but also the cost of exploring new resources.},

	abstract = {Nectar standing crops in flowers within an individual plant are often highly variable. This variability may be a by-product of the foraging activity of insect pollinators. Alternatively, plants may be selected to produce highly variable rewards to reduce consecutive visitation by risk-averse pollinators, thus diminishing within-plant pollen transfer. This study evaluated the roles of pollinator control vs. plant control over nectar variability in the bee-pollinated shrub Rosmarinus officinalis L. (Lamiaceae). We sampled nectar production, standing crop and pollinator visits in three shrubs of one population over 17 days during one blooming season. Nectar production rates were highly variable ({CV} = 1.48), and increased after rainy days. Nectar standing crops were even more variable ({CV} = 2.16), decreased with increasing temperatures, and increased with time since the last rain. Pollinator visit rates decreased with variability in nectar standing crops, increased with flower number per shrub, and were unaffected by variability in nectar production rates. Repeated sampling of marked flowers revealed no correlation between their nectar standing crops and production rates. These findings support the role of reward variance in reducing pollinator visits, but suggest that plants are not in complete control of this variability. Rather, plant-generated variability can be modified by intensive foraging activity of pollinators. Such pollinator control over nectar variability is likely to reduce the selective advantage of plant-generated reward variation.},

The contribution of this article is fourfold: First, the conceptual foundation of the psychological heuristics research program is provided, along with a discussion of its relationship to soft and hard {OR}. Second, empirical evidence and theoretical analyses are presented on the conditions under which psychological heuristics perform on par with or even better than more complex standard models in decision problems such as multi-attribute choice, classification, and forecasting, and in domains as varied as health, economics and management. Third, we demonstrate the application of the psychological heuristics approach to the problem of reducing civilian casualties in military stability operations.

	abstract = {High blood glucose levels caused by excessive sugar consumption are detrimental to mammalian health and life expectancy. Despite consuming vast quantities of sugar-rich floral nectar, nectar-feeding bats are long-lived, provoking the question of how they regulate blood glucose. We investigated blood glucose levels in nectar-feeding bats (Glossophaga soricina) in experiments in which we varied the amount of dietary sugar or flight time. Blood glucose levels increased with the quantity of glucose ingested and exceeded 25 mmol l−1 blood in resting bats, which is among the highest values ever recorded in mammals fed sugar quantities similar to their natural diet. During normal feeding, blood glucose values decreased with increasing flight time, but only fell to expected values when bats spent 75 per cent of their time airborne. Either nectar-feeding bats have evolved mechanisms to avoid negative health effects of hyperglycaemia, or high activity is key to balancing blood glucose levels during foraging. We suggest that the coevolutionary specialization of bats towards a nectar diet was supported by the high activity and elevated metabolic rates of these bats. High activity may have conferred benefits to the bats in terms of behavioural interactions and foraging success, and is simultaneously likely to have increased their efficiency as plant pollinators.},

We identify three nectar drinking techniques: active suction, capillary suction, and viscous dipping. For each, we deduce the dependence of the volume intake rate on the nectar viscosity and thus infer an optimal sugar concentration consistent with laboratory measurements. Our results provide the first rationale for why suction feeders typically pollinate flowers with lower sugar concentration nectar than their counterparts that use viscous dipping.},

	abstract = {Top predators inhabiting a dynamic environment, such as coastal waters, should theoretically possess sufficient cognitive ability to allow successful foraging despite unpredictable sensory stimuli. The cognition-related hunting abilities of marine mammals have been widely demonstrated. Having been historically underestimated, teleost cognitive abilities have also now been significantly demonstrated. Conversely, the abilities of elasmobranchs have received little attention, despite many species possessing relatively large brains comparable to some mammals. The need to determine what, if any, cognitive ability these globally distributed, apex predators are endowed with has been highlighted recently by questions arising from environmental assessments, specifically whether they are able to learn to distinguish between anthropogenic electric fields and prey bioelectric fields. We therefore used electroreceptive foraging behaviour in a model species, Scyliorhinus canicula (small-spotted catshark), to determine cognitive ability by analysing whether elasmobranchs are able to learn to improve foraging efficiency and remember learned behavioural adaptations. Positive reinforcement, operant conditioning was used to study catshark foraging behaviour towards artificial, prey-type electric fields (Efields). Catsharks rewarded with food for responding to Efields throughout experimental weeks were compared with catsharks that were not rewarded for responding in order to assess behavioural adaptation via learning ability. Experiments were repeated after a 3-week interval with previously rewarded catsharks this time receiving no reward and vice versa to assess memory ability. Positive reinforcement markedly and rapidly altered catshark foraging behaviour. Rewarded catsharks exhibited significantly more interest in the electrical stimulus than unrewarded catsharks. Furthermore, they improved their foraging efficiency over time by learning to locate and bite the electrodes to gain food more quickly. In contrast, unrewarded catsharks showed some habituation, whereby their responses to the electrodes abated and eventually entirely ceased, though they generally showed no changes in most foraging parameters. Behavioural adaptations were not retained after the interval suggesting learned behaviour was not memorised beyond the interval. Sequences of individual catshark search paths clearly illustrated learning and habituation behavioural adaptation. This study demonstrated learning and habituation occurring after few foraging events and a memory window of between 12 h and 3 weeks. These cognitive abilities are discussed in relation to diet, habitat, ecology and anthropogenic Efield sources.},

Thresholds were determined using signal-detection theory (d′=1.0 or d′=1.8) and the criterion of 50\% correct responses. For a fixed level, the average Weber fraction ΔT/T (criterion of d′=1.8) significantly decreased from 1.18 or 1.23 at reference durations of 50 or 100 ms, respectively, to 0.97 at a reference duration of 200 ms.

	abstract = {Bat echolocation is primarily used for orientation and foraging but also holds great potential for social communication. The communicative function of echolocation calls is still largely unstudied, especially in the wild. Eavesdropping on vocal signatures encoding social information in echolocation calls has not, to our knowledge, been studied in free-living bats so far. We analysed echolocation calls of the polygynous bat Saccopteryx bilineata and found pronounced vocal signatures encoding sex and individual identity. We showed experimentally that free-living males discriminate approaching male and female conspecifics solely based on their echolocation calls. Males always produced aggressive vocalizations when hearing male echolocation calls and courtship vocalizations when hearing female echolocation calls; hence, they responded with complex social vocalizations in the appropriate social context. Our study demonstrates that social information encoded in bat echolocation calls plays a crucial and hitherto underestimated role for eavesdropping conspecifics and thus facilitates social communication in a highly mobile nocturnal mammal.},

This faculty is very rare and patchily distributed within the animal kingdom, suggesting multiple instances of convergent evolution. It has long been predicted that bats should be capable of vocal imitation and our results provide evidence for this phenomenon. We report that pups of the bat Saccopteryx bilineata learn a complex vocalization through vocal imitation. During ontogeny, pups of both sexes imitate territorial song from adult males, starting with simple precursor songs that develop into genuine renditions. The resemblance of pup renditions to their acoustic model is not caused by physical maturation effects, is independent of pups' gender and relatedness towards adult males and becomes more pronounced during ontogeny, showing that auditory experience is essential for vocal development. Our findings indicate that the faculty of vocal imitation is more widespread than previously thought and emphasize the importance of research on audiovocal communication in bats for a better understanding of the evolutionary origin of vocal imitation.},

We examined the effects of viscosity, separately from those of sugar concentration, on feeding by captive whitebellied sunbirds (Cinnyris talatala). Viscosities of artificial nectar (sucrose solutions ranging in concentration from 0.25 to 1.5 mol/l) were altered with Tylose, an inert polysaccharide. Food consumption was measured over 3 h, and lick frequency and duration were recorded using photodetection devices on feeding apertures too small for the bill but large enough for the extended tongue. Volumetric intake rates (ml/s) were inversely proportional to nectar viscosity, and were similar over the range of sucrose concentrations when viscosity was held constant. Sucrose intake rates (mg/s) remained the same on pure sucrose solutions, but they decreased with increasing viscosity at a constant sucrose concentration. Lick frequencies and tongue loads were reduced at high viscosities, and lick duration increased, which confirms that sunbirds take longer to ingest viscous solutions. Licking behavior was remarkably similar in birds feeding on different sucrose concentrations if viscosity was held constant. Nectar ingestion rate is determined by viscosity; however, total food intake is mainly modulated by sugar concentration. Similar effects of food viscosity have been observed in insects that suck nectar.},

	abstract = {Almost all bees collect nectar and pollen from flowers. Female bees collect pollen to provision their nest cells, whereas they use nectar for individual energy supply and nest cell provisioning. Bees fine-tune nectar foraging to the amount and to the concentration of nectar, but the individual bees' response to variability of amount and concentration of pollen reward has not yet been studied thoroughly in laboratory settings. We developed an experimental set-up in which bumblebees simultaneously collected sugar solution and pollen from artificial flowers; natural pollen was mixed with cellulose powder or glass powder as a pollen surrogate. Here we show that bumblebee (Bombus terrestris) workers do not specialise in nectar or pollen collection, but regularly collect both rewards on the same day. When offered a fixed pollen reward and varied amounts and concentrations of sugar solution, the bumblebees fine-tuned sugar solution foraging dependent on both the volume and concentration, with strong preferences for the highest concentration and the greatest volume. In the reciprocal tests, when offered a fixed sugar reward and varied amounts and concentrations of pollen mixed with a nutrient-free pollen surrogate, the bumblebees follow more an all-or-none rule for pollen, accepting all amounts and concentrations except pure surrogate. It is discussed how the bumblebees' ability to sense sugar, and their apparent inability to sense the pollen protein content, shaped their foraging behaviour. It is argued that the rarity of nectar mimicry and the frequency of pollen mimicry in natural flowers might be interpreted in the context of divergent abilities of nectar and pollen recognition in bees.},

	abstract = {Ecological studies on feral populations of mice, fish and birds elucidate the functional significance of phenotypes that differ individually in their behavioral and neuroendocrine response to environmental challenge. Within a species, the capacity to cope with environmental challenges largely determines individual survival in the natural habitat. Recent studies indicate that individual variation within a species may buffer the species for strong fluctuations in the natural habitat. A conceptual framework will be presented that is based on the view that individual variation in aggressive behavior can be considered more generally as a variation in actively coping with environmental challenges. Highly aggressive individuals adopt a proactive coping style whereas low levels of aggression indicate a more passive or reactive style of coping. Coping styles have now been identified in a range of species and can be considered as trait characteristics that are stable over time and across situations. The dimension of coping style seems to be independent of an emotionality dimension. Hence, in the analysis of the proximate mechanisms of stress and adaptation, one has to consider the possibility that the mechanisms which determine the type of stress response might be independent from those underlying the magnitude of the response. The two coping styles differ in a number of important neurobiological and neuroendocrine systems. For example, proactive males differ significantly from reactive males in the homeostatic control of serotonergic activity resulting in completely opposite dose response relationships of various serotonergic drugs. The results so far show that proactive coping is characterized by a strong inhibitory control of the 5-{HT} neuron via its somatodendritic 5-{HT}(1A) autoreceptor. It is hypothesized that the regulation of serotonin release is causally related to coping style rather than emotionality. Understanding the functional individual variation as it occurs in nature and the underlying neurobiology and neuroendocrinology is fundamental in understanding individual vulnerability to stress related disease.},

We show that stimulation of neurons that express Neuropeptide F ({dNPF}), an ortholog of mammalian {NPY}, mimicks food-deprivation and promotes memory performance in satiated flies. Robust appetitive memory performance requires the {dNPF} receptor in six dopaminergic neurons that innervate a distinct region of the mushroom bodies. Blocking these dopaminergic neurons releases memory performance in satiated flies whereas stimulation suppresses memory performance in hungry flies. Therefore {dNPF} and dopamine provide a motivational switch in the mushroom body that controls the output of appetitive memory.},

The spatial separation of sex organs, herkogamy, is believed to limit sexual interference in hermaphrodite flowers. Reverse herkogamy (stigma recessed below anthers) and long, narrow corolla tubes are expected to promote efficiency in male function under hawkmoth pollination. We tested this prediction by measuring selection in six experimental arrays of Polemonium brandegeei, a species that displays continuous variation in herkogamy, resulting in a range of recessed to exserted stigmas. Under glasshouse conditions, we measured pollen removal and deposition, and estimated selection gradients (β) through female fitness (seeds set) and male fitness (siring success based on six polymorphic microsatellite loci). Siring success was higher in plants with more nectar sugar and narrow corolla tubes. However, selection through female function for reverse herkogamy was considerably stronger than was selection through male function. Hawkmoths were initially attracted to larger flowers, but overall preferred plants with reverse herkogamy. Greater pollen deposition and seed set also occurred in reverse herkogamous plants. Thus, reverse herkogamy may be maintained by hawkmoths through female rather than male function. Further, our results suggest that pollinator attraction may play a considerable role in enhancing female function.},

	abstract = {Up to 29\% of all adults will experience an anxiety-related disorder during their lives. Treatment of these disorders is still difficult and the exact mechanisms and pathways behind anxiety disorders remain to be elucidated. Although evidence exists for genetically based susceptibility of human psychiatric diseases, risk genes have rarely been identified up to now. Inbred mouse strains are, together with the crosses and genetic reference populations derived from them, important tools for the genetic dissection of complex behavioral traits in the mouse. Thus, inbred mouse models of human anxiety may be a potent starting tool to search for candidate genes in mice, which could then via comparative genomics be translated to the human situation. In this paper we investigate whether the A/J and C57BL/6J mouse inbred strains differ in a limited number of motivational systems (anxiety, exploration, memory, locomotion, and social affinity), but especially in anxiety-related behavior from each other. Young adult individuals from both genders of A/J and C57BL/6J strains were behaviorally phenotyped using a multidimensional test: the modified hole board. This paradigm basically is a combination of the traditional hole board and the open field test allowing to test for anxiety-related avoidance behavior, risk assessment, arousal, exploration, memory, locomotor activity, and social affinity, using just one single test. An acute, aversive stimulus (intra-peritoneal injection with saline) was applied to the animals to test for the robustness of their behavioral phenotype. In addition, presumed physiological indicators for anxiety (circulating glucose, cholesterol, and corticosterone, adrenal tyrosine hydroxylase, and blood plasma and brain magnesium) were investigated. It could be concluded that C57BL/6J and A/J mice differ with respect to almost all tested motivational systems. For some measures, including anxiety-related behavioral parameters, there were clear gender effects. The high-anxiety phenotype of A/J mice could be shown to represent a primary and robust characteristic. Further, blood plasma and brain magnesium levels were significantly correlated with several anxiety-related behavioral parameters. These results emphasize the hypothesized, and possibly causal, association between magnesium status and emotionality.},

	abstract = {Most models of animal foraging and consumer choice assume that individuals make choices based on the absolute value of items and are therefore ‘economically rational’. However, frequent violations of rationality by animals, including humans, suggest that animals use comparative valuation rules. Are comparative valuation strategies a consequence of the way brains process information, or are they an intrinsic feature of biological decision-making? Here, we examine the principles of rationality in an organism with radically different information-processing mechanisms: the brainless, unicellular, slime mould Physarum polycephalum. We offered P. polycephalum amoebas a choice between food options that varied in food quality and light exposure (P. polycephalum is photophobic). The use of an absolute valuation rule will lead to two properties: transitivity and independence of irrelevant alternatives ({IIA}). Transitivity is satisfied if preferences have a consistent, linear ordering, while {IIA} states that a decision maker's preference for an item should not change if the choice set is expanded. A violation of either of these principles suggests the use of comparative rather than absolute valuation rules. Physarum polycephalum satisfied transitivity by having linear preference rankings. However, P. polycephalum's preference for a focal alternative increased when a third, inferior quality option was added to the choice set, thus violating {IIA} and suggesting the use of a comparative valuation process. The discovery of comparative valuation rules in a unicellular organism suggests that comparative valuation rules are ubiquitous, if not universal, among biological decision makers.},

	abstract = {Risk is a ubiquitous feature of the environment for most organisms, who must often choose between a small and certain reward and a larger but less certain reward. To study choice behavior under risk in a genetically well characterized species, we trained mice (C57BL/6) on a discrete trial, concurrent-choice task in which they must choose between two levers. Pressing one lever (safe choice) is always followed by a small reward. Pressing the other lever (risky choice) is followed by a larger reward, but only on some of the trials. The overall payoff is the same on both levers. When mice were not food deprived, they were indifferent to risk, choosing both levers with equal probability regardless of the level of risk. In contrast, following food or water deprivation, mice earning 10\% sucrose solution were risk-averse, though the addition of alcohol to the sucrose solution dose-dependently reduced risk aversion, even before the mice became intoxicated. Our results falsify the budget rule in optimal foraging theory often used to explain behavior under risk. Instead, they suggest that the overall demand or desired amount for a particular reward determines risk preference. Changes in motivational state or reward identity affect risk preference by changing demand. Any manipulation that increases the demand for a reward also increases risk aversion, by selectively increasing the frequency of safe choices without affecting frequency of risky choices.},

Nectar production was measured under high and low-water treatments for high and low nectar-producing genetic lines in a growth chamber. In the field the response of nectar production and pollinator behaviour to water availability for potted plants chosen from field populations was studied. 2. Plants selected from high-nectar lines produced significantly more nectar than those selected from low-nectar lines. Nectar production thus had a heritable component. 3. Under high water conditions plants produced more nectar than under low water conditions. The increase in nectar production under high water availability was strongest for the low-nectar plants, demonstrating a genotype by environment interaction. Only under dry conditions, which usually prevail during the flowering period of E. vulgare, high and low-nectar plants differ in nectar production. 4. Plants selected from high-nectar lines had a significantly higher root mass and root: shoot ratio. This suggests that they are less affected by low water availability and thus able to maintain high nectar production under dry conditions. 5. In the field, high-nectar plants produced significantly more nectar but did not receive more pollinator visits. Watered plants produced significantly more nectar and did receive an enhanced pollinator service. When watered, nectar production and pollinator service was similar for high and low-nectar plants.},

	abstract = {The relationship between foraging behavior and resource availability for the long-nosed bat (Glossophaga soricina) and five species of plants it fed on in northern Columbia was investigated in a 10-mo study. Glossophaga employed two foraging tactics: (1) territorial defense of concentrated food sources, and (2) trapline foraging along regularly used feeding routes. The tactic used depended on availability of Agave desmettiana nectar and the individual bat's ability to dominate conspecifics. When both hunger and nectar levels were highest, bats concentrated their feeding activity on A. desmettiana. Aggressive behavior was displayed by dominant male and female bats during the first 3-5 h of feeding. Territorial behavior ceased suddenly when nectar levels were depleted by 50\% or more at 2.5-5 h after sunset. Later in the evening, bats foraged briefly from one plant to another at several species along regularly used routes. Bats that maintained early-evening territories had increased access to nectar-rich agave flowers and had significantly smaller total foraging areas than nonterritorial bats. The feeding territories of female Glossophaga were shared with their immature offspring. Territorial behavior at agave was attributed in part to defensibility of its flowers. Foraging experiments demonstrated that G. soricina used a feeding strategy that was efficient with respect to choice of food patch and allocation of time. This is the first study that used marked individuals to document feeding territories and trapline foraging for nectar-feeding bats.},

We show that {SWEET}9 is essential for nectar production and can function as an efflux transporter. We also show that sucrose phosphate synthase genes, encoding key enzymes for sucrose biosynthesis, are highly expressed in nectaries and that their expression is also essential for nectar secretion. Together these data are consistent with a model in which sucrose is synthesized in the nectary parenchyma and subsequently secreted into the extracellular space via {SWEET}9, where sucrose is hydrolysed by an apoplasmic invertase to produce a mixture of sucrose, glucose and fructose. The recruitment of {SWEET}9 for sucrose export may have been a key innovation, and could have coincided with the evolution of core eudicots and contributed to the evolution of nectar secretion to reward pollinators.},

	abstract = {Over the past several decades, economists, psychologists, and neuroscientists have conducted experiments in which a subject, human or animal, repeatedly chooses between alternative actions and is rewarded based on choice history. While individual choices are unpredictable, aggregate behavior typically follows Herrnstein's matching law: the average reward per choice is equal for all chosen alternatives. In general, matching behavior does not maximize the overall reward delivered to the subject, and therefore matching appears inconsistent with the principle of utility maximization. Here we show that matching can be made consistent with maximization by regarding the choices of a single subject as being made by a sequence of multiple selves—one for each instant of time. If each self is blind to the state of the world and discounts future rewards completely, then the resulting game has at least one Nash equilibrium that satisfies both Herrnstein's matching law and the unpredictability of individual choices. This equilibrium is, in general, Pareto suboptimal, and can be understood as a mutual defection of the multiple selves in an intertemporal prisoner's dilemma.},

This behavior is remarkably conserved across species and experimental conditions, but its underlying neural mechanisms still are unknown. Here, we propose a neural explanation of this empirical law of behavior. We hypothesize that there are forms of synaptic plasticity driven by the covariance between reward and neural activity and prove mathematically that matching is a generic outcome of such plasticity. Two hypothetical types of synaptic plasticity, embedded in decision-making neural network models, are shown to yield matching behavior in numerical simulations, in accord with our general theorem. We show how this class of models can be tested experimentally by making reward not only contingent on the choices of the subject but also directly contingent on fluctuations in neural activity. Maximization is shown to be a generic outcome of synaptic plasticity driven by the sum of the covariances between reward and all past neural activities.},

	abstract = {It is widely believed that learning is due, at least in part, to long-lasting modifications of the strengths of synapses in the brain. Theoretical studies have shown that a family of synaptic plasticity rules, in which synaptic changes are driven by covariance, is particularly useful for many forms of learning, including associative memory, gradient estimation, and operant conditioning. Covariance-based plasticity is inherently sensitive. Even a slight mistuning of the parameters of a covariance-based plasticity rule is likely to result in substantial changes in synaptic efficacies. Therefore, the biological relevance of covariance-based plasticity models is questionable. Here, we study the effects of mistuning parameters of the plasticity rule in a decision making model in which synaptic plasticity is driven by the covariance of reward and neural activity. An exact covariance plasticity rule yields Herrnstein's matching law. We show that although the effect of slight mistuning of the plasticity rule on the synaptic efficacies is large, the behavioral effect is small. Thus, matching behavior is robust to mistuning of the parameters of the covariance-based plasticity rule. Furthermore, the mistuned covariance rule results in undermatching, which is consistent with experimentally observed behavior. These results substantiate the hypothesis that approximate covariance-based synaptic plasticity underlies operant conditioning. However, we show that the mistuning of the mean subtraction makes behavior sensitive to the mistuning of the properties of the decision making network. Thus, there is a tradeoff between the robustness of matching behavior to changes in the plasticity rule and its robustness to changes in the properties of the decision making network.},

	abstract = {We investigated the effect of sucrose concentration on the patterns of feeding, gut function, and energy management in the nectar-eating Chilean hummingbird Sephanoides sephanoides. We interpreted these results using a simple model of digestive function. The predictions of this model are: (a) Hummingbirds should exhibit 100\% assimilation efficiency of sugars at all sugar concentrations; (b) Daily rates of energy intake should be positively correlated with sugar concentration; and (c) Increased sugar concentration should lead to linearly increasing meal retention times, and, therefore, to linearly increasing time intervals between meals. In agreement with the model, hummingbirds exhibited almost complete assimilation of sugars and increased meal retention times and intermeal intervals with increased sugar concentration. Hummingbirds did not, however, show any significant differences in daily energy intake when fed different sugar concentrations. Birds differed in their temporal pattern of feeding when fed solutions with sucrose solutions of contrasting concentrations. At low food sucrose concentrations (0.25 M), birds showed a burst of feeding before dark. In contrast, birds feeding on higher sucrose concentrations (0.5 M and 0.75 M) showed steadily declining feeding activity throughout the day. In addition to measuring the behavior and gut function of hummingbirds, we also measured their daily patterns of energy use using respirometry. Hummingbirds showed considerable flexibility in their patterns of energy use. The amount of energy used at night was positively correlated with the surplus of energy (intake minus diurnal expenditures) at dusk. Although birds exhibited only small variation in total daily energy budgets as a function of sugar concentration, birds feeding at the lowest sucrose concentration (0.25 M) seemed to rely on nocturnal torpor with more frequency than those fed on higher concentrations. We conclude that energy maximization is probably an inappropriate assumption for birds that are not growing, storing fat, or reproducing. We present a modification of the original model that allows assuming that birds do not maximize energy intake, but rather maintain constant rates of energy intake. We describe experiments and criteria that allow discriminating among the two models.},

Using basic examples from imprinting and associative learning, we argue that by coevolving to handle the natural distribution of data in the animal's environment, learning and data-acquisition mechanisms are tuned jointly so as to facilitate effective learning using relatively little memory and computation. We then suggest that this coevolutionary process offers a feasible path for the incremental evolution of complex cognitive systems, because it can greatly simplify learning. This is illustrated by considering how animals and humans can use these simple mechanisms to learn complex patterns and represent them in the brain.

	abstract = {Sucrose, glucose, and fructose are the three sugars that commonly occur in floral nectar and fruit pulp. The relative proportions of these three sugars in nectar and fruit in relation to the sugar preferences of pollinators and seed dispersers have received considerable attention. Based on the research of Herbert and Irene Baker and their collaborators, a dichotomy between sucrose-dominant hummingbird-pollinated flowers and hexose-dominant passerine flowers and fruits was proposed. Data on sugar preferences of several hummingbird species (which prefer sucrose) vs. a smaller sample of passerines (which prefer hexoses) neatly fitted this apparent dichotomy. This hummingbird–passerine dichotomy was strongly emphasized until the discovery of South African plants with sucrose-dominant nectars, which are pollinated by passerines that are able to digest, and prefer sucrose. Now we know that, with the exception of two clades, most passerines are able to assimilate sucrose. Most sugar preference studies have been conducted using a single, relatively high, sugar concentration in the nectar (ca 20\%). Thus, we lack information about the role that sugar concentration might play in sugar selection. Because many digestive traits are strongly affected not only by sugar composition, but also by sugar concentration, we suggest that preferences for different sugar compositions are concentration-dependent. Indeed, recent studies on several unrelated nectar-feeding birds have found a distinct switch from hexose preference at low concentrations to sucrose preference at higher concentrations. Finally, we present some hypotheses about the role that birds could have played in molding the sugar composition of plant rewards.},

	abstract = {Humans can spontaneously create rules that allow them to efficiently generalize what they have learned to novel situations. An enduring question is whether rule-based generalization is uniquely human or whether other animals can also abstract rules and apply them to novel situations. In recent years, there have been a number of high-profile claims that animals such as rats can learn rules. Most of those claims are quite weak because it is possible to demonstrate that simple associative systems (which do not learn rules) can account for the behavior in those tasks. Using a procedure that allows us to clearly distinguish feature-based from rule-based generalization (the Shanks–Darby procedure), we demonstrate that adult humans show rule-based generalization in this task, while generalization in rats and pigeons was based on featural overlap between stimuli. In brief, when learning that a stimulus made of two components (“{AB}”) predicts a different outcome than its elements (“A” and “B”), people spontaneously abstract an opposites rule and apply it to new stimuli (e.g., knowing that “C” and “D” predict one outcome, they will predict that “{CD}” predicts the opposite outcome). Rats and pigeons show the reverse behavior—they generalize what they have learned, but on the basis of similarity (e.g., “{CD}” is similar to “C” and “D”, so the same outcome is predicted for the compound stimulus as for the components). Genuinely rule-based behavior is observed in humans, but not in rats and pigeons, in the current procedure.},

Food rewards from both sources were always identical. After an equal number of reinforced trials with each source, the birds were presented with choices between them. The birds significantly preferred the source that had previously delivered food under higher deprivation. We relate these results to findings reported elsewhere of preferences for options previously associated with greater effort. We hypothesize that subjects may attribute value to an option according to the marginal fitness gain associated with this option in the past.

Importantly, this means that the components of a what, where, when memory task should be dissociable (e.g. what would be remembered to a different degree than when). We tested this hypothesis by training hummingbirds to a memory task, where the location of a reward was specified according to colour (what), location (where), and order and time of day (when). Although hummingbirds remembered these three pieces of information together more often than expected, there was a hierarchy as to how they were remembered. When seemed to be the hardest to remember, while errors relating to what were more easily corrected. Furthermore, when appears to have been encoded as a combination of time of day and sequence information. As hummingbirds solved this task using reconstruction of different memory components (what, where and when), we suggest that similar deconstructive approaches may offer a useful way to compare episodic and episodic-like memories.},

The evolution of bat pollination was associated with floral transitions reflecting the chiropterophilous floral syndrome. The evolution of generalization was associated with subcampanulate corollas. Autonomous breeding systems evolved only in hummingbird-pollinated lineages. • The correlated evolution of floral traits and pollination systems provides support for the pollination syndrome concept. Floral transitions may have been favored by the low frequency of hummingbird visitation in the Antilles, while the presence of autonomous pollination may have allowed the diversification of ornithophilous lineages.

Interest in measuring individual variation in reaction norms using mixed-effects and, more specifically, random regression models have grown apace in the last few years within evolution and ecology. However, these are data hungry methods, and little effort to date has been put into understanding how much and what kind of data we need to collect in order to apply these models usefully and reliably.2. We conducted simulations to address three central questions. First, what is the best sampling strategy to collect sufficient data to test for individual variation using random regression models? Second, on occasions when precision is difficult to assess, can we be confident that a failure to detect significant variance in plasticity using random regression represents a biological reality rather than a lack of statistical power? Finally, does the common practice of censoring individuals with one or few repeated measures improve or reduce power to estimate individual variation in random regressions?3. We have also developed a series of easy-to-use functions in the ‘pamm’ statistical package for R, which is freely available, that will allow researchers to conduct similar power analyses tailored more specifically to their own data.4. Our results reveal potentially useful rules of thumb: large data sets (N {\textgreater} 200) are needed to evaluate the variance of individual-specific slopes; a number of individuals/number of observations per individual ratio of approximately 0·5 consistently yielded the highest power to detect random effects; individuals with one or few observations should not generally be censored as this reduces power to detect variance in plasticity.5. We discuss the wider implications of these simulations and remaining challenges and suggest a new way to standardize results that would better facilitate the comparison of findings across empirical studies.},

	abstract = {Nectar-feeding vertebrates respond to variation in nectar sugar content by modulating volumetric intake. In some nectar feeding animals, the intake response to sugar concentration can be accurately predicted from simple mathematical models that rely on knowledge of gut morphology, in vitro rates of sugar digestion, and daily energy expenditures. Because most of the floral nectars consumed by vertebrates are dilute, these animals ingest large amounts of water while feeding. The water turnover rates of hummingbirds feeding on dilute nectar are more similar to those of amphibious and aquatic organisms than to those of terrestrial vertebrates. Dilute nectars can pose osmoregulatory challenges for nectarivores. Nectarivorous birds exhibit renal traits that are well suited to dispose of large water loads and that appear inadequate to produce concentrated urine. Nectar-feeding birds prefer concentrated over dilute sugar solutions. However, the concentration difference that they can discriminate is smaller at low than at high concentration. We hypothesize that this pattern is a consequence of the functional form of intake responses that often results in decelerating sugar intakes with increasing sugar concentration. The diminishing returns in floral attractivity that may result from increased nectar concentration may be one of the reasons why the nectars of hummingbird pollinated flowers are dilute in spite of the preference of birds for higher concentrations. The intake responses of nectar-feeding birds capture the integration of a behavioral response with the physiological processes that shape it. Because the behavior of nectar-feeding birds can have consequences for the plants that they visit, the intake response may also have coevolutionary effects.},

We investigated sugar preferences, assimilation efficiency and water flux in a Neotropical honeycreeper, the Bananaquit (Coereba flaveola; Coerebidae), a member of a radiation of tanagers and finches. Bananaquits showed no preference for nearly equicaloric (25\% w/v) sucrose, glucose, fructose or glucoseâ€“fructose mixtures in pair-wise choice tests. In agreement with this lack of preference, they were equally efficient at absorbing sucrose and both hexoses. Apparent assimilation efficiency of these sugars was around 97.5\%. In pair-wise tests, Bananaquits displayed a strong preference for the most concentrated sucrose solution when the lowest concentration ranged from 276 to 522 {mM}. Between 522 and 1120 {mM} sucrose solution concentrations, Bananaquits were able to adjust their volumetric food intake in order to maintain a constant energy intake. At solution concentration of 276 {mM}, birds could not maintain their rate of energy intake by increasing food consumption enough. We consider that at low sugar concentrations, Bananaquits faced a physiological constraint; they were unable to process food at a fast enough rate to meet their energy needs. We also explored the possibility that dilute nectars might be essential to sustain high water needs of Bananaquits by allowing them to control osmolarity of the food. Between 276 and 1120 {mM} sucrose solution concentrations, average amount of free water drunk by Bananaquits was independent of food concentration. They drank very little supplementary water and did not effectively dilute concentrated nectars. The evidence suggests that water bulk of dilute nectars is a burden to Bananaquits.},

	abstract = {There is growing evidence that individuals within populations show consistent differences in their behaviour across contexts (personality), and that personality is associated with the extent to which individuals adjust their behaviour as function of changing conditions (behavioural plasticity). We propose an evolutionary explanation for a link between personality and plasticity based upon how individuals manage uncertainty. Individuals can employ three categories of tactics to manage uncertainty. They can 1) gather information (sample) to reduce uncertainty, 2) show strategic (state-dependent) preferences for options that differ in their associated variances in rewards (i.e. variance-sensitivity), or 3) invest in insurance to mitigate the consequences of uncertainty. We explicitly outline how individual differences in the use of any of these tactics can generate personality-related differences in behavioural plasticity. For example, sampling effort is likely to co-vary with individual activity and exploration behaviours, while simultaneously creating population variation in reactions to changes in environmental conditions. Individual differences in the use of insurance may be associated with differences in risk-taking behaviours, such as boldness in the face of predation, thereby influencing the degree of adaptive plasticity across individuals. Population variation in responsiveness to environmental changes may also reflect individual differences in variance-sensitivity, because stochastic change in the environment increases variances in rewards, which may both attract and benefit variance-prone individuals, but not variance-averse individuals. We review the existing evidence that individual variation in strategies for managing uncertainty exist, and describe how positive-feedbacks between sampling, variance-sensitivity and insurance can maintain and exaggerate even small initial differences between individuals in the relative use of these tactics. Given the pervasiveness of the problem of uncertainty, alternative strategies for managing uncertainty may provide a powerful explanation for consistent differences in behaviour and behavioural plasticity for a wide range of traits.},

	abstract = {Computational learning models are critical for understanding mechanisms of adaptive behavior. However, the two major current frameworks, reinforcement learning ({RL}) and Bayesian learning, both have certain limitations. For example, many Bayesian models are agnostic of inter-individual variability and involve complicated integrals, making online learning difficult. Here, we introduce a generic hierarchical Bayesian framework for individual learning under multiple forms of uncertainty (e.g., environmental volatility and perceptual uncertainty). The model assumes Gaussian random walks of states at all but the first level, with the step size determined by the next highest level. The coupling between levels is controlled by parameters that shape the influence of uncertainty on learning in a subject-specific fashion. Using variational Bayes under a mean-field approximation and a novel approximation to the posterior energy function, we derive trial-by-trial update equations which (i) are analytical and extremely efficient, enabling real-time learning, (ii) have a natural interpretation in terms of {RL}, and (iii) contain parameters representing processes which play a key role in current theories of learning, e.g., precision-weighting of prediction error. These parameters allow for the expression of individual differences in learning and may relate to specific neuromodulatory mechanisms in the brain. Our model is very general: it can deal with both discrete and continuous states and equally accounts for deterministic and probabilistic relations between environmental events and perceptual states (i.e., situations with and without perceptual uncertainty). These properties are illustrated by simulations and analyses of empirical time series. Overall, our framework provides a novel foundation for understanding normal and pathological learning that contextualizes {RL} within a generic Bayesian scheme and thus connects it to principles of optimality from probability theory.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The relationship between sucrose concentration of nectar and volume uptake rate by the butterflies Agraulis vanillae (Nymphalidae) and Phoebis sennae (Pieridae) was examined. Recent theoretical models simulating feeding energetics of nectarivores have assumed that this volume uptake rate is produced by a constant but undetermined pressure drop (the difference between pressure at the proximal and distal ends of the feeding channel) at all nectar concentrations. These models predict that nectar of 20-25\% sucrose maximizes the rate of energy intake and should thus be preferred by nectarivores. Data collected for Agraulis and Phoebis falsify this pressure drop assumption; both species produce greater pressure drops with increasing nectar concentration. In addition, males of both species produce greater suction pressure and uptake rates than females. This results in greater rates of energy intake for males of both species. The volume uptake rates produced by each species differ from those predicted by the models. This produces a maximal rate of energy intake at 35-40\% sucrose rather than 20-25\%. The empirically determined relationship between energy intake rate and nectar concentration resembles that predicted for discontinuous nectar feeders such as hummingbirds more closely than the relationship predicted for continuous suction feeders, suggesting that other basic assumptions about the feeding mechanism of butterflies should be critically examined.},

The masking function (log detectable increment vs log background intensity) is found to have a slope of 9/10 when calculations are carried out via energy measurements. This near-miss to Weber’s law is in agreement with other data reported in the literature. The masking slope proves to be essentially independent of stimulus duration between 15 msec and 1.5 sec. Our stable slope parameter is interpreted as a detectability restriction generated by “mass-flow” phenomena in the auditory channel. These phenomena are thought to be similar to the fluctuations accompanying a noisy or turbulent stream of events. Pure-tone intensity discrimination is then analyzed as a special case of energy detection.},

The bias presents a challenge to normative models of decision making (which only take account of expected rewards and the state of the animal at the decision time). To understand the behavior, we take a broad ecological perspective and consider how valuation mechanisms evolve when the best action depends upon the environment being faced. We show that in a changing and uncertain environment, state-dependent valuation can be favored by natural selection: Individuals should allow their hunger to affect learning for future decisions. The valuation mechanism that typically evolves produces the kind of behavior seen in standard laboratory tests. By providing an insight into why learning should be affected by the state of an individual, we provide a basis for understanding psychological principles in terms of an animal's ecology.},

Existing explanations for these effects are based on descriptive models of psychological and physiological processes, but little attention has been paid to the factors promoting their evolution. Using a simple and general optimality model, we show that contrast effects can result from an adaptive response to uncertainty in a changing, unpredictable world. A wide range of patterns of environmental change will select for sensitivity to past conditions, generating positive and negative contrast effects. Our analysis reveals the importance of incorporating uncertainty and environmental stochasticity into models of adaptive behavior.
Choice in Changing Environments
Animals, including humans, generally tend to judge the world on relative, rather than absolute, terms. For example, the value of a particular object or reward is generally determined based on comparison to other rewards we have received in the past or to those that others have received. Such contrast effects can have negative or positive impacts on our behavior. {McNamara} et al. (p. 1084) used an optimality model to show that contrast effects could evolve as an adaptive response to environmental instability and unpredictability.},

	abstract = {To determine general or species-specific properties in neural systems, it is necessary to use comparative data in evaluating experimental findings. Presented here are data on associative learning and memory formation in honeybees, emphasizing a comparative approach. We focus on four aspects: (1) the role of an identified neuron, {VUMmx}1, as a neural substrate of appetitive reinforcement; (2) the sequences of molecular events as they correlate with five forms of memory stages; (3) the localization of the memory traces following appetitive olfactory learning; and (4) the brief description of several forms of complex learning in bees (configuration in olfactory conditioning, categorization in visual feature learning, delayed matching-to-sample learning, and latent learning in navigation). {VUMmx}1 activity following the conditioned stimulus odor is sufficient to replace the unconditioned stimulus, and {VUMmx}1changes its response properties during learning similarly to what is known from dopamine neurons in the basal ganglia of the mammalian brain. The transition from short- to mid- and long-term forms of memory can be related to specific activation of second messenger cascades (involving {NOS}, {PKA}, {PKC}, and {PKM}) resembling general features of neural plasticity at the cellular level. The particular time course of the various memory traces may be adapted to the behavioral context in which they are used; here, the foraging cycle of the bee. Memory traces for even such a simple form of learning as olfactory conditioning are multiple and distributed, involving first- and second-order sensory neuropils (antennal lobe and mushroom bodies), but with distinctly different properties. The wealth of complex forms of learning in the context of foraging indicates basic cognitive capacities based on rule extraction and context-dependent learning. It is believed that bees might be a useful model for studying cognitive faculties at a middle level of complexity.},

	abstract = {In recent years, the use of operant conditioning procedures has shown that species as diverse as chimpanzees, honeybees, and mosquitofish can be trained to discriminate between sets containing different numbers of objects. However, to succeed in this task, subjects can use two different strategies: either select the array containing a specific number of items (an absolute numerosity rule), or select the set containing the larger (or smaller) quantity of items (a relative numerosity rule). In the latter case, subjects need not only be able to judge whether two numerosities are equal or different but also be able to order numerosities. Here, in two experiments, we address whether fish can perform both kinds of judgment by training them with specific numerosities and testing their generalization to new numerosity contrasts. In Experiment 1, subjects were initially trained to select between visual arrays of 6 and 12 shapes, and were then tested with a contrast pairing the previously trained numerosity (either 6 or 12) with a novel numerosity (respectively, 3 or 24). Spontaneously, subjects selected the novel numerosity, in accordance with a relative numerosity rule. The second experiment tested whether guppies can also learn to select one specific number against all others, if appropriately trained. Fish trained to select an array of 4 shapes against several alternatives (4 vs. 1, 4 vs. 2, 4 vs. 8, 4 vs. 10) learned to recognize the number 4 against all alternatives and proved able to generalize their discrimination to novel, more difficult contrasts (4 vs. 3 and 4 vs. 6 items). In summary, although guppies preferentially opt for relative comparisons, they can flexibly learn either relative or absolute decision criteria on numerosity stimuli, depending on the context.},

Previous studies suggest both consummatory and instrumental paradigms have the potential to provide an objective measure of affective state in rodents. We first investigated whether an {SNC} effect is observed in an operant task based on the 5 choice serial reaction time task. We then tested whether this {SNC} effect was sensitive to differences in affective state induced by manipulating the home cage environment. In animals trained to receive a four pellet food reward, reinforcer downshift to a single reward pellet induced a significant slowing of both correct response and collection latencies to levels below that of animals which had only ever received the lower value reward, indicating a {SNC} effect. Home cage environmental enrichment resulted in a paradoxical effect on responses in this {SNC} task where animals housed in a barren environment showed faster baseline response times and the {SNC} effect was significantly attenuated. These data suggest that the animals housed in the barren conditions were in a more positive affective and/or motivational state during testing than animals housed in enriched cages. Although opposite to the effects of housing conditions in a runway {SNC} task, these data could be explained by the enriching effects of daily training in an operant task. Rather than inducing a negative affective state in rats, the barren housing conditions resulted in a relatively more positive affective state in the chamber when compared to animals living in a highly enriched environment.},

Only a handful of studies have quantified heritable variation for nectar traits, primarily in controlled environments that minimize environmental variation. Most such studies have reported strong genetic influences, with heritabilities often {\textgreater}0.35. However, because nectar traits are often very responsive to environmental variation, even substantial amounts of genetic variation may be swamped out in the field. Environmental variation deserves to be studied in its own right, including exploration of genotype x environment interaction for nectar traits. Most genetic studies of nectar have focused on production rate and concentration, whereas we know almost nothing about the heritability of other important traits such as production patterns, sugar ratios, amino acid composition, taste, and scent. Likewise, almost nothing is known about the heritability of extrafloral nectar traits. Important progress on all of these fronts can be made using simple experimental designs to quantify environmental effects, genotype x environment interactions, clonal repeatability, and correlated traits. There is great promise in molecular approaches, but their use will not obviate the need for more quantitative genetic studies in the field and greenhouse.},

Red Wattlebirds (Anthochaera carunculata, 110 g), achieved higher intake rates than New Holland Honeyeaters (Phylidonyris novaehollandiae, 20 g), and both achieved higher rates than Eastern Spinebills (Acanthorhynchus tenuirostris, 10 g). These results reflect differences in bill and tongue dimensions as well as in body mass. Sugar intake rates for all three species increased with volume (5-50 μl) at any given concentration (10-60\% mass/mass sucrose). For a given volume, sugar intake rates peaked at intermediate concentrations: 40-50\% for the two larger species, and 30-40\% for the smallest species. Published studies for other nectarivores foraging at unlimited volume feeders also show optimal nectar concentrations of 30-50\%. However, biophysical theory predicts optima at 20-26\% for small volumes, and plants presumed to be adapted for bird-pollination often have dilute nectar (20-30\%). To explore this discrepancy further, we presented New Holland Honeyeaters with a range of sucrose concentrations (10-50\%) using two presentation schemes. In the first we varied concentration but kept volume constant, thus varying gross sugar reward available in each concentration. This gave maximum sugar intake rates at 50\%. In the second we varied both volume and concentration so that gross sugar rewards were equal for all solutions, decoupling high concentrations and large sugar rewards. This gave optima at 20\%. We argue that variation among plants in nature more closely resembles the latter, "equal sugar presentation" scheme, and therefore, that dilute nectars may indeed represent adaptations for bird pollination.},

Reported violations of rationality in non-humans include intransitivity (i.e. circular preferences) and lack of independence of irrelevant alternatives (changes in relative preference between options when embedded in different choice sets), but the extent to which these observations truly represent breaches of rationality is debatable. We tested both principles with starlings (Sturnus vulgaris), training subjects either with five options differing in food delay (exp. 1) or with six options differing in reward probability (exp. 2), before letting them choose repeatedly one option out of several binary and trinary sets of options. The starlings conformed to economic rationality on both tests, showing strong stochastic transitivity and no violation of the independence principle.

When the options varied only in volume, the addition of a high volume option to a choice set of low and medium options decreased the birds' preference for the medium option. We saw no effects of adding a third option when the options varied in corolla length alone.

Here, we test for such selective pressures in the highly specialized mutualism between the nectar bat Anoura fistulata, which can extend its tongue twice as far as other nectar bats, and Centropogon nigricans, which has flowers of a similar length (8-9 cm). We used flight cage experiments to examine the effects of artificially manipulated flower lengths on (i) bat behaviour and (ii) pollen transfer. Increased length produced longer visits, but did not affect the force bats applied during visits. In the second experiment, flower length increased both the male and female components of flower function: long male flowers delivered more pollen grains and long female flowers received more pollen grains. However, pollen transfer was not correlated with visit duration, so the mechanism behind differences in pollen transfer remains unclear. By demonstrating that bats select for increasing flower length, these results are consistent with the hypothesis that A. fistulata evolved its remarkable tongue in a coevolutionary race with long-tubed flowers similar to that envisioned by Darwin.},

In the present study, we investigated the neural code underlying the perception of stimulus intensity in the somatosensory system. We first characterized the responses of {SA}1 (slowly adapting type 1), {RA} (rapidly adapting), and {PC} (Pacinian) afferents of macaque monkeys to sinusoidal, diharmonic, and bandpass noise stimuli. We then had human subjects rate the perceived intensity of a subset of these stimuli. On the basis of these neurophysiological and psychophysical measurements, we evaluated a series of hypotheses about which aspect(s) of the neural activity evoked at the somatosensory periphery account for perception. We evaluated three types of neural codes. The first consisted of population codes based on the firing rate of neurons located directly under the probe. The second included population codes based on the firing rate of the entire population of active neurons. The third included codes based on the number of active afferents. We found that the response evoked in the localized population is logarithmic with stimulus amplitude (given a constant frequency composition), whereas the population response across all neurons is linear with stimulus amplitude. We conclude that stimulus intensity is best accounted for by the firing rate evoked in afferents located under or near the locus of stimulation, weighted by afferent type.},

	abstract = {Repeatable behavioural traits (‘personality’) have been shown to covary with fitness, but it remains poorly understood how such behaviour–fitness relationships come about. We applied a multivariate approach to reveal the mechanistic pathways by which variation in exploratory and aggressive behaviour is translated into variation in reproductive success in a natural population of blue tits, Cyanistes caeruleus. Using path analysis, we demonstrate a key role for provisioning behaviour in mediating the link between personality and reproductive success (number of fledged offspring). Aggressive males fed their nestlings at lower rates than less aggressive individuals. At the same time, their low parental investment was associated with increased female effort, thereby positively affecting fledgling production. Whereas male exploratory behaviour was unrelated to provisioning behaviour and reproductive success, fast-exploring females fed their offspring at higher rates and initiated breeding earlier, thus increasing reproductive success. Our findings provide strong support for specific mechanistic pathways linking components of behavioural syndromes to reproductive success. Importantly, relationships between behavioural phenotypes and reproductive success were obscured when considering simple bivariate relationships, underlining the importance of adopting multivariate views and statistical tools as path analysis to the study of behavioural evolution.},

Nectar-feeding pollinators, when given a choice, tend to prefer nectar with high concentrations of sugar. Nectar-producing plants, however, tend to produce more dilute nectar. This mismatch between selective force and trait value has long been seen as an evolutionary paradox. Nachev et al. used a dynamic flower array that evolved in real time in a Costa Rican rainforest to show that the “paradox” is, in fact, driven by pollinator choices (see the Perspective by Farris). Bat pollinators based their choices on small, nonlinear differences in nectar sweetness, which led to selection for less sweet nectar overall.
Science, this issue p. 75; see also p. 25
Plants pollinated by hummingbirds or bats produce dilute nectars even though these animals prefer more concentrated sugar solutions. This mismatch is an unsolved evolutionary paradox. Here we show that lower quality, or more dilute, nectars evolve when the strength of preferring larger quantities or higher qualities of nectar diminishes as magnitudes of the physical stimuli increase. In a virtual evolution experiment conducted in the tropical rainforest, bats visited computer-automated flowers with simulated genomes that evolved relatively dilute nectars. Simulations replicated this evolution only when value functions, which relate the physical stimuli to subjective sensations, were nonlinear. Selection also depended on the supply/demand ratio; bats selected for more dilute nectar when competition for food was higher. We predict such a pattern to generally occur when decision-makers consider multiple value dimensions simultaneously, and increases of psychological value are not fully proportional to increases in physical magnitude.
Patterns of choice by bats lead plants to produce nonoptimal nectar in a real-time evolution simulation experiment.

The physical properties of rewards are presumed to be represented on context-dependent, nonlinear cognitive scales that may systematically influence reward expectation and thus choice behavior. In this study, we investigated the discrimination performance of free-flying bumblebee workers (Bombus impatiens) in a choice between sucrose solutions with different concentrations. We conducted two-alternative free choice experiments on two B. impatiens colonies containing some electronically tagged bumblebees foraging at an array of computer-automated artificial flowers that recorded individual choices. We mimicked natural foraging conditions by allowing uncertainty in the probability of reward delivery while maintaining certainty in reward concentration. We used a Bayesian approach to fit psychometric functions, relating the strength of preference for the higher concentration option to the relative intensity of the presented stimuli. Psychometric analysis was performed on visitation data from individually marked bumblebees and pooled data from unmarked individuals. Bumblebees preferred the more concentrated sugar solutions at high stimulus intensities and showed no preference at low stimulus intensities. The obtained psychometric function is consistent with reward evaluation based on perceived concentration contrast between choices. We found no evidence that bumblebees reduce reward expectations upon experiencing non-rewarded visits. We compare psychometric function parameters between the bumblebee B. impatiens and the flower bat Glossophaga commissarisi and discuss the relevance of psychophysics for pollinator-exerted selection pressures on plants.},

	abstract = {Repeatability (more precisely the common measure of repeatability, the intra-class correlation coefficient, {ICC}) is an important index for quantifying the accuracy of measurements and the constancy of phenotypes. It is the proportion of phenotypic variation that can be attributed to between-subject (or between-group) variation. As a consequence, the non-repeatable fraction of phenotypic variation is the sum of measurement error and phenotypic flexibility. There are several ways to estimate repeatability for Gaussian data, but there are no formal agreements on how repeatability should be calculated for non-Gaussian data (e.g. binary, proportion and count data). In addition to point estimates, appropriate uncertainty estimates (standard errors and confidence intervals) and statistical significance for repeatability estimates are required regardless of the types of data. We review the methods for calculating repeatability and the associated statistics for Gaussian and non-Gaussian data. For Gaussian data, we present three common approaches for estimating repeatability: correlation-based, analysis of variance ({ANOVA})-based and linear mixed-effects model ({LMM})-based methods, while for non-Gaussian data, we focus on generalised linear mixed-effects models ({GLMM}) that allow the estimation of repeatability on the original and on the underlying latent scale. We also address a number of methods for calculating standard errors, confidence intervals and statistical significance; the most accurate and recommended methods are parametric bootstrapping, randomisation tests and Bayesian approaches. We advocate the use of {LMM}- and {GLMM}-based approaches mainly because of the ease with which confounding variables can be controlled for. Furthermore, we compare two types of repeatability (ordinary repeatability and extrapolated repeatability) in relation to narrow-sense heritability. This review serves as a collection of guidelines and recommendations for biologists to calculate repeatability and heritability from both Gaussian and non-Gaussian data.},

	abstract = {{SYNOPSIS}. Nectar is a simple food consisting of varying proportions of sucrose, glucose and fructose dissolved in water. The mechanisms of its secretion are poorly understood. Osmosis may explain why hexose-rich nectars are produced in larger volumes and are more dilute than sucrose-rich nectars. Unless protected, nectar tends to equilibrate with ambient humidity, and the concentrations available to flower visitors can vary from 7–70\% w/w. Most nectars are osmotically concentrated, especially when rich in hexose sugars. The only digestion needed is sucrose hydrolysis, and monosaccharides and water are rapidly absorbed across the midgut of insects. Large flying insects feeding on nectar produce an excess of water which must be eliminated by evaporation and excretion. Animals which utilise this attractively packaged and easily digested food source may have osmoregulatory problems when nectar concentrations do not match their water requirements.},

Many southern African plants that are pollinated by passerine birds produce nectars with little or no sucrose. Moreover, these hexose nectars are extremely dilute (10–15\%). This suggests a link between sugar composition and nectar concentration. Nectar originates from sucrose-rich phloem sap, and the proportion of monosaccharides depends on the presence and activity of invertase in the nectary. Hydrolysis of sucrose increases nectar osmolality and the resulting water influx can potentially convert a 30\% sucrose nectar into a 20\% hexose nectar, with a 1.56 times increase in volume. Hydrolysis may also increase the gradient for sucrose transport and thus the rate of sugar secretion. When sucrose content and refractometer data were compared, some significant correlations were seen, but the occurrence of sucrose-rich or hexose-rich nectars can also be explained on phylogenetic grounds (e.g. Erythrina and Protea). Hexose nectars may be abundant enough to drip from open flowers, but evaporation leads to much variability in nectar concentration and increases the choices available to pollinators.},

	abstract = {Evolution of animal morphology, physiology and behaviour is shaped by the selective pressures to which they are subject. Some selective pressures act to increase the benefits accrued whilst others act to reduce the costs incurred, affecting the cost/benefit ratio. Selective pressures therefore produce a trade-off between costs and benefits that ultimately influences the fitness of the whole organism. The nervous system has a unique position as the interface between morphology, physiology and behaviour; the final output of the nervous system is the behaviour of the animal, which is a product of both its morphology and physiology. The nervous system is under selective pressure to generate adaptive behaviour, but at the same time is subject to costs related to the amount of energy that it consumes. Characterising this trade-off between costs and benefits is essential to understanding the evolution of nervous systems, including our own. Within the nervous system, sensory systems are the most amenable to analysing costs and benefits, not only because their function can be more readily defined than that of many central brain regions and their benefits quantified in terms of their performance, but also because recent studies of sensory systems have begun to directly assess their energetic costs. Our review focuses on the visual system in particular, although the principles we discuss are equally applicable throughout the nervous system. Examples are taken from a wide range of sensory modalities in both vertebrates and invertebrates. We aim to place the studies we review into an evolutionary framework. We combine experimentally determined measures of energy consumption from whole retinas of rabbits and flies with intracellular measurements of energy consumption from single fly photoreceptors and recently constructed energy budgets for neural processing in rats to assess the contributions of various components to neuronal energy consumption. Taken together, these studies emphasize the high costs of maintaining neurons at rest and whilst signalling. A substantial proportion of neuronal energy consumption is related to the movements of ions across the neuronal cell membrane through ion channels, though other processes such as vesicle loading and transmitter recycling also consume energy. Many of the energetic costs within neurons are linked to 3Na+/2K+ {ATPase} activity, which consumes energy to pump Na+ and K+ ions across the cell membrane and is essential for the maintenance of the resting potential and its restoration following signalling. Furthermore, recent studies in fly photoreceptors show that energetic costs can be related, via basic biophysical relationships, to their function. These findings emphasize that neurons are subject to a law of diminishing returns that severely penalizes excess functional capacity with increased energetic costs. The high energetic costs associated with neural tissue favour energy efficient coding and wiring schemes, which have been found in numerous sensory systems.

People seem to have access, although limited, to unconscious generative models that can generalise to explain other verbal reasoning results. Error does not emerge predominantly from System 1, but rather seems to emerge from the later evolved System 2 that involves working memory and language. However language also sows the seeds of error correction by moving reasoning into the social domain.

	abstract = {Many foraging animals return to feeding sites to harvest replenishing resources, but little is known about efficient tactics for doing this. Can animals with adequate cognitive abilities increase their efficiency by modifying their behavior according to memories of past experience at particular sites? We developed a simulation model of animals harvesting renewable resources from isolated patches in undefended, competitive situations. We compared four foraging tactics: (1) moving stochastically without using any information from past experiences (random searching); (2) moving stochastically, but going longer distances after encountering lower reward (area-restricted searching); (3) repeatedly moving along a fixed route (complete traplining); and (4) traplining, but sampling and shifting to neighboring rewarding patches after encountering low reward (sample-and-shift traplining). Following Possingham, we tracked both the resources actually harvested by a focal forager (i.e., rewards) and the standing crops of resources that accumulated at patches. Complete traplining always produces less variation in elapsed time between visits than random searching or area-restricted searching, which has three benefits: increasing the reward crop harvested, if resource renews nonlinearly; reducing resource standing crop in patches; and reducing variation in reward crop per patch. Moreover, the systematic revisitation schedule produced by complete traplining makes it more competitive, regardless of resource renewal schedule or competitor frequency. By responding to their past experiences, using sample-and-shift traplining, foragers benefit only when many patches are left unvisited in the habitat. Otherwise, the exploratory component of sample-and-shift traplining, which increases the movement distance and the variation in elapsed time between visits, makes it more costly than complete traplining. Thus, traplining will usually be beneficial, but foragers should switch between “impatient” (sample-and-shift traplining) and “tenacious” (complete traplining) traplining, according to temporal changes in surrounding situations.},

However, as Kuhn (1962) argued in his seminal discussion of paradigm shifts, an old paradigm cannot be abandoned until a new paradigm emerges to replace it. In this article, we argue that the recent shift in researcher attention toward basic cognitive processes that give rise to decision phenomena constitutes the beginning of that replacement paradigm. Models grounded in basic perceptual, attentional, memory, and aggregation processes have begun to proliferate. The development of this new approach closely aligns with Kuhn's notion of paradigm shift, suggesting that this is a particularly generative and revolutionary time to be studying decision science.},

Empirical evidence suggests that in many ecologically relevant situations, decision difficulty and the relative reward from making a correct choice, compared to an incorrect one, are inversely linked, implying that it is optimal to use relatively less time for difficult choice problems. This applies, in particular, to value-based choices, in which the relative reward from choosing the higher valued item shrinks as the values of the other options get closer to the best option and are thus more difficult to discriminate. Here, we experimentally show that people behave sub-optimally in such contexts. They do not respond to incentives that favour the allocation of time to choice problems in which the relative reward for choosing the best option is high; instead they spend too much time on problems in which the reward difference between the options is low. We demonstrate this by showing that it is possible to improve subjects' time allocation with a simple intervention that cuts them off when their decisions take too long. Thus, we provide a novel form of evidence that organisms systematically spend their valuable time in an inefficient way, and simultaneously offer a potential solution to the problem.},

The social behavior of insects is a result of complex interactions at different levels of biological organization. Genes give rise to proteins and peptides that build the nervous and muscular systems, regulate their own synthesis, interact with each other, and affect the behavior of individuals. Social behavior emerges from the complex interactions of individuals that are themselves far removed from the direct effects of the genes. In order to understand how social organization evolves, we must understand the mechanisms that link the different levels of organization. In this review, we discuss how behavior is influenced by genes and the neural system and how social behavior emerges from the behavioral activities of individuals. We show how different levels of organization share common features and are linked through common mechanisms. We focus on the behavior of the honey bee, the best studied of all social insects.},

Sucrose concentrations of nectar loads were positively correlated with response thresholds measured on 1-week-old bees.

Thus, 32–4\% and 16–2\% downshifts (1:8 test/training ratios) caused similar levels of consummatory behavior, despite differences in the absolute concentrations of the solutions involved in the downshift. An interpretation based on sensory contrast was discarded because of the long intervals between training and test solutions (40\&\#xa0;min and 24\&\#xa0;h in Experiments 1 and 2, respectively). It is suggested that Weber’s law regulates behavioral suppression after reward downshifts. A theoretical framework for the interpretation of these data is presented.},

	shorttitle = {Peripheral Foraging by Territorial Rufous Hummingbirds},
	abstract = {Rufous Hummingbirds in the Sierra Nevada Mountains were observed to forage in the edge areas of their territories during the first few hours of the day, evenly over their territories during midday, and in the territory cores in late afternoon. This distribution of foraging effort appeared to be inconsistent with maximizing their rates of net energy gain during foraging. If Rufous Hummingbirds were to maximize their net energy gain during individual foraging bouts, foraging effort would have to be distributed evenly over the territory at all times of the day. We present a model which suggests that the observed feeding behavior of territorial Rufous Hummingbirds leads to higher daily net energy gains and lower food losses than if the birds maximized only net energy gain during each foraging bout during the day. Intrusion pressure accounts for the early-morning bias of foraging of edge areas. Intruders attempted to rob nectar from flowers in the edge areas of territories much more frequently than in the cores, and a higher proportion of these attempts were successful. Intruders frequently returned within 5-10 min to the sites that they had just robbed, and returned most frequently to those territories where they were able to rob for the longest time (on average) before being detected and chased. Nectar levels on territories were highest at dawn, and since edges were more prone to food losses than were cores, the territory owner minimized losses by feeding in the edge areas early in the morning. After chasing intruders from their territories, owners often returned and fed in the site just robbed by the intruder, which also reduced food losses by depleting nectar levels in areas prone to intrusion. According to the model, reduction of reintrusion rates by lowering the yield per intrusion and thereby discouraging robbers contributes more to the owner's benefit than does simple pre-emption of the resource by the owner. Thus, the peripheral foraging behavior of hummingbirds and their feeding response following intrusions are components of territory defense. Such "defense by exploitation" may be common when food resources are being defended, and should be considered along with aggressive exclusion of intruders ("defense by interference") in the overall strategies of territorial animals. We close with a speculation that the late-afternoon foraging bias to the core may raise foraging efficiency during the time of day when the birds are heaviest and therefore have the highest foraging cost.},

Representative species of the hummingbird, bee, bat and moth pollination syndromes were sampled in relation to their numeric importance in the tribe. In hummingbird and bee flowers, which represent 95\% of the species in Sinningieae, nectar was sucrose-dominant (ratio [sucrose]/[hexose] {\textgreater} 1). Sugar ratios below one were only found in the nectar of three species with moth and bat syndromes. Sugar concentration averaged 23.9 ± 10.6\% (wt/total wt) in hummingbird flowers and 28.7 ± 10.6\% in bee flowers, whereas diluted nectar (7.1 ± 3.4\%) was restricted to bat flowers. Similarities in the nectar of hummingbird and bee flowers contrast with the presence of specific morphological traits associated with these two syndromes, indicating that plant-pollinator relationships rely on flower display rather than on nectar characteristics. By contrast, distinct nectar chemistry is correlated with the bat syndrome in which a particularly low sucrose production is responsible for hexose dominance.

	abstract = {Whether invertebrates exhibit positive emotion–like states and what mechanisms underlie such states remain poorly understood. We demonstrate that bumblebees exhibit dopamine-dependent positive emotion–like states across behavioral contexts. After training with one rewarding and one unrewarding cue, bees that received pretest sucrose responded in a positive manner toward ambiguous cues. In a second experiment, pretest consumption of sucrose solution resulted in a shorter time to reinitiate foraging after a simulated predator attack. These behavioral changes were abolished with topical application of the dopamine antagonist fluphenazine. Further experiments established that pretest sucrose does not simply cause bees to become more exploratory. Our findings present a new opportunity for understanding the fundamental neural elements of emotions and may alter the view of how emotion states affect decision-making in animals.},

Here, we investigate this possibility in the nine-spined stickleback (Pungitius pungitius) by manipulating the number of demonstrator fish at two feeders, one rich and one poor, during a demonstration phase and evaluating how this affects the likelihood that the focal fish copy the demonstrators' apparent choices. As predicted, we observed a significantly increased level of copying with increasing numbers of demonstrators at the richer of the two feeders, with copying increasing disproportionately, rather than linearly, with the proportion of demonstrators at the rich foraging patch. Control conditions with non-feeding demonstrators showed that this was not simply the result of a preference for shoaling with larger groups, implying that nine-spined sticklebacks copy in a conformist manner.},

	abstract = {In their influential paper, Wichmann and Hill (2001, Perception \& Psychophysics, 63, 1293–1313) have shown that the threshold and slope estimates of a psychometric function may be severely biased when we assume that the lapse rate equals 0 but lapses do, in fact, occur. Wichmann and Hill also claim that threshold and slope estimates are essentially unbiased when we allow the lapse rate to vary within a rectangular Bayesian prior during the fitting procedure. Here I fail to replicate Wichmann and Hill's results. Instead, I show that both threshold and slope estimates are biased when we follow Wichmann and Hill's suggestion to estimate the lapse rate. I explain the mechanism behind the bias in detail. Fortunately, since we are rarely interested in the absolute value of a threshold or slope, bias in the estimates thereof need not necessarily be a problem. Instead, we are generally concerned with whether differences among parameter values exist between experimental conditions. I demonstrate that, unlike estimates of the absolute value of thresholds, estimates of differences between thresholds values obtained in different conditions are unbiased even if an assumed, fixed lapse rate does not match the true, generating lapse rate. Similarly, results of statistical model comparisons are virtually unaffected by a mismatch between an assumed, fixed lapse rate and the generating lapse rate. In contrast, severe negative consequences for statistical model comparisons can be obtained when we allow the lapse rates to vary during fitting. I explain the mechanism behind these negative consequences in detail. Overall, my results indicate that unless we are interested in the absolute values of the parameters of a psychometric function, we should not, and need not, estimate the lapse rate.},

Labrador retrievers (N = 16) were repeatedly presented with one toy for successive 30-s periods until interaction ceased. At this point (habituation), a different toy was presented that contrasted with the first in both colour and odour (since the dog’s saliva would have accumulated on the first), colour alone, or odour alone. No effect of the type of contrast was detected in the number of presentations to habituation, the difference in duration of interaction between the first presentation of the first toy and the presentation of the second toy (recovery), or the duration of interaction with the second toy (dishabituation). Varying the time interval between successive presentations of the first toy up to habituation between 10 s and 10 min had no effect on the number of presentations to habituation, nor did it alter the extent of dishabituation. Varying the delay from habituation to presentation of the second toy, between 10 s and 15 min, affected neither the recovery nor the dishabituation. Overall, the study indicates that loss of interest in the object during object-orientated play in this species is due to habituation to the overall stimulus properties of the toy rather than to any single sensory modality and is also atypical in its insensitivity to the interval between presentations.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND} Honeybees (Apis mellifera) exhibit an extraordinarily tuned division of labor that depends on age polyethism. This adjustment is generally associated with the fact that individuals of different ages display different response thresholds to given stimuli, which determine specific behaviors. For instance, the sucrose-response threshold ({SRT}) which largely depends on genetic factors may also be affected by the nectar sugar content. However, it remains unknown whether {SRTs} in workers of different ages and tasks can differ depending on gustatory and olfactory experiences. {METHODOLOGY} Groups of worker bees reared either in an artificial environment or else in a queen-right colony, were exposed to different reward conditions at different adult ages. Gustatory response scores ({GRSs}) and odor-memory retrieval were measured in bees that were previously exposed to changes in food characteristics. {PRINCIPAL} {FINDINGS} Results show that the gustatory responses of pre-foraging-aged bees are affected by changes in sucrose solution concentration and also to the presence of an odor provided it is presented as scented sucrose solution. In contrast no differences in worker responses were observed when presented with odor only in the rearing environment. Fast modulation of {GRSs} was observed in older bees (12-16 days of age) which are commonly involved in food processing tasks within the hive, while slower modulation times were observed in younger bees (commonly nurse bees, 6-9 days of age). This suggests that older food-processing bees have a higher plasticity when responding to fluctuations in resource information than younger hive bees. Adjustments in the number of trophallaxis events were also found when scented food circulated inside the nest, and this was positively correlated with the differences in timing observed in gustatory responsiveness and memory retention for hive bees of different age classes. {CONCLUSIONS} This work demonstrates the accessibility of chemosensory information in the honeybee colonies with respect to incoming nectar. The modulation of the sensory-response systems within the hive can have important effects on the dynamics of food transfer and information propagation.},

Bats were offered sucrose solutions between 146 and 1,168 mmol L(-1). Contrary to our expectations, long-tongued bats did not show compensatory feeding, suggesting that volumetric food intake is physiologically constrained. Energy intake was lower at the most dilute solutions (146-584 mmol L(-1)) and then remained relatively constant at more concentrated diets (876 and 1,168 mmol L(-1)). The shape of the observed intake response was very similar to the one predicted by a model dependent on intestinal morphology and in vitro sucrase activity. However, the model predicted higher volumetric food intake at the lower concentrations tested, which suggests that the intestines of the bats were not functioning to their full capacity. Rates of sucrose hydrolysis and water processing probably constrain food intake in long-tongued bats as diets get more dilute.},

	abstract = {Understanding animals’ abilities to cooperate with and learn from each other has been an active field of research in recent years. One important basis for all types of social interactions is the disposition of animals to pay attention to each other—a factor often neglected in discussions and experiments. Since attention differs between species as well as between individuals, it is likely to influence the amount and type of information different species and/or observers may extract from conspecifics in any given situation. Here, we carried out a standardized comparative study on attention towards a model demonstrating food-related behavior in keas, dogs and children. In a series of experimental sessions, individuals watched different conspecific models while searching, manipulating and feeding. Visual access to the demonstration was provided by two observation holes, which allowed us to determine exactly how often and for how long observers watched the model.

Such socially learned route preferences can be stably maintained over multiple transmission episodes, sometimes forming long-lived traditions. In humans, preferences for familiar routes or heavily used worn trails over unfamiliar ones have been described in various contexts. However, social learning of route preferences has not been experimentally demonstrated in humans. Here, we demonstrate that social learning and tradition influence route choice. We led adult male and female participants into a room by one of two routes. Participants followed the demonstrated route choices, and later remembered and preferred this choice even when determinably suboptimal (i.e. longer and not preferred by control participants) or when the choice was indicated as arbitrary (the demonstrator took one route to retrieve a poster that had ostensibly fallen). Moreover, route preferences were stably maintained over multiple transmission episodes. We suggest that simple social learning processes, often neglected in human and primate research, can result in long-lived route preferences that may influence a range of additional behaviour patterns.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The influence of variability in nectar reward per flower on the foraging behavior of individual bumblebees (Bombus sandersoni Fkln.) and paper wasps (Vespula vulgaris L.) was explored during late summer 1979. The area around each colony was enclosed in mosquito netting, and an artificial floral patch, yellow and blue cardboard squares randomly mixed and fixed beneath wells in a clear sheet of plexiglass, was established within the enclosure. The nectar reward per flower (i.e., the volume) was manipulated to generate different degrees of variability within a floral type. The first set of experiments had equal quantities of nectar in all yellow and blue flowers. Individual foraging bees showed a significant preference for yellow. However, when blue flowers were kept constant (2 @{mL} in each) and yellow made variable (6 @{mL} in every third flower and none in the remainder), individual foragers avoided the variable yellow even though the expected reward from yellow was equal to blue. As a control, the variable floral type was reversed with yellow now constant. Individual foragers then showed an equally strong avoidance of blue flowers. In order to insure that bees were avoiding uncertainty rather than merely avoiding empty flowers, a new set of experiments was run with some nectar in every flower. The constant floral type contained 2 @{mL} of nectar in every flower while the variable type contained 5 @{mL} in every third and .5 @{mL} in the remainder. Again the foragers preferred the constant floral type; however, the preference was not as great as when there were empty flowers. Analysis of the sequence of visits made by individual forages seems to indicate that bees learned to distinguish the variable floral type during the foraging bout. Similar experiments were run on the wasps. When flowers were of equal quality, the wasps preferred yellow to blue. When one floral type was variable and the other constant, the wasps preferred the constant type. For the same magnitude of variability, however, the bumblebee's avoidance of the variable floral type was more pronounced than was the wasps' response. The results of these experiments are then analyzed within the context of a more general model of foraging behavior in variable environments.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The individual's behavioral response to the environment is a consequence of three processes. Information from the environment must be encoded into a form that can be manipulated and stored in the nervous system. Encoded information is then subject to computational operations that lead to a representation of the environment that forms the basis for decisions and actions. The design of information-processing schemes acts as both a constraint on behavioral response and an aspect of the organism's phenotype that may be subject to natural selection. My experiments with bumblebees suggest that individual workers process information about floral rewards according to expected utility theory. Utility is here defined by a biomechanical function relating floral reward sizes to rates of net energetic gain. This model also suggests that bees process information from successive visits so as to maximize expected short-term (rather than long-term) energetic gain. Short-term computational algorithms may prove advantageous when environments are spatially or temporally autocorrelated or when individuals are subject to short-term memory constraints. Short-term computational algorithms may lead to perceptual biases, for example, underestimation of low-probability events. Observations on the computational rules employed by individuals may reveal aspects of nervous system organization and operation. At the same time, the floral preferences that result from individual decision making may have profound consequences for the evolution of pollinator-plant interactions and ecological community organization.},

In this article, we use decision theory to show that Bayesian tests can also describe Fisher-style ‘screening’ procedures, and that such approaches lead directly to Bayesian analogs of the Wald test and two-sided p-value, and to Bayesian tests with frequentist properties that can be determined easily and accurately. In contrast to hypothesis testing, these ‘screening’ decisions do not exhibit the Lindley/Jeffreys paradox, that divides frequentists and Bayesians.},

Because of changing environmental conditions, honey bee, Apis mellifera , nectar foragers must constantly assess resources. A forager's perception of resource profitability may be affected by her past foraging experience. To test this, the concentrations of sucrose solutions in feeders were varied and dance characteristics that serve as indicators of resource profitability were recorded. Round dances of foragers that had last visited a lesser concentration than that on which they were presently foraging had higher rates of directional reversal, circuit rates and speeds than those of foragers on the same concentration that had last visited a feeder offering a higher sucrose concentration. Dance information related to resource profitability was thus modulated by the immediate past experience of a forager, and was not based strictly on absolute resource profitability. Losses were weighted more heavily than gains. Contrary to the assumptions of current models of optimal prey choice, past foraging experience can influence resource assessment.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Hummingbird tongues pick up a liquid, calorie-dense food that cannot be grasped, a physical challenge that has long inspired the study of nectar-transport mechanics. Existing biophysical models predict optimal hummingbird foraging on the basis of equations that assume that fluid rises through the tongue in the same way as through capillary tubes. We demonstrate that the hummingbird tongue does not function like a pair of tiny, static tubes drawing up floral nectar via capillary action. Instead, we show that the tongue tip is a dynamic liquid-trapping device that changes configuration and shape dramatically as it moves in and out of fluids. We also show that the tongue–fluid interactions are identical in both living and dead birds, demonstrating that this mechanism is a function of the tongue structure itself, and therefore highly efficient because no energy expenditure by the bird is required to drive the opening and closing of the trap. Our results rule out previous conclusions from capillarity-based models of nectar feeding and highlight the necessity of developing a new biophysical model for nectar intake in hummingbirds. Our findings have ramifications for the study of feeding mechanics in other nectarivorous birds, and for the understanding of the evolution of nectarivory in general. We propose a conceptual mechanical explanation for this unique fluid-trapping capacity, with far-reaching practical applications (e.g., biomimetics).},

Body mass, daily activity time, and vegetation consumption rates for individuals were measured in the field, along with the average water content of vegetation at each ground squirrel colony. I also measured stomach and caecal capacity and turnover rate of plant food through the digestive tract for individuals in the laboratory to construct regressions of digestive capacity as a function of individual body mass. Finally, I obtained literature estimates of average daily energy requirements as a function of body mass and digestible energy content of vegetation. These data were used to construct a linear programming diet model for each individual. The model for each individual was used to predict the proportion of two food types (monocots and dicots) that maximized daily energy intake, given time and digestive constraints on foraging. Individuals were classified as "optimal" or "deviating", depending on whether their observed diet was significantly different from their predicted optimal diet. I determined the consequences of selecting an optimal diet for energy intake and fitness. As expected, daily energy intake calculated for deviators (based on their observed diet proportion) was less than that for optimal foragers. Deviating foragers do not appear to compensate for their lower calculated energy intake through other factors such as body size or physiological efficiency of processing food. Growth rate, yearly survivorship, and litter size increase with calculated energy intake, and optimal foragers have six times the reproductive success of deviators by age three. Optimal foraging behavior, therefore, appears to confer a considerable fitness advantage.},

We show that the above conclusions also hold for other distributions, such as the inverse Gaussian distribution derived from drift-diffusion models. A straightforward way to test the key assumptions of {SUT} is suggested and possible extensions, future prospects and mechanistic underpinnings are discussed.},

In an effort to identify genes involved in nectar production, the Affymetrix® {ATH}1 {GeneChip} was previously used to examine global gene expression profiles in Arabidopsis thaliana nectaries. One of the genes displaying highly enriched expression in nectaries was {CELL} {WALL} {INVERTASE} 4 ({AtCWINV}4, At2g36190), which encodes an enzyme that putatively catalyses the hydrolysis of sucrose into glucose and fructose. {RT}-{PCR} was used to confirm the nectary-enriched expression of {AtCWINV}4, as well as an orthologue from Brassica rapa. To probe biological function, two independent Arabidopsis cwinv4 T-{DNA} mutants were isolated. Unlike wild-type plants, cwinv4 lines did not produce nectar. While overall nectary morphology appeared to be normal, cwinv4 flowers accumulated higher than normal levels of starch in the receptacle, but not within the nectaries themselves. Conversely, wild-type, but not cwinv4, nectarial stomata stained intensely for starch. Cell wall extracts prepared from mutant flowers displayed greatly reduced invertase activity when compared with wild-type plants, and cwinv4 flowers also accumulated significantly lower levels of total soluble sugar. Cumulatively, these results implicate {CWINV}4 as an absolutely required factor for nectar production in the Brassicaceae, specifically by maintaining constant sink status within nectaries, thus allowing them to accumulate the sugars necessary for nectar production. In addition, {CWINV}4 is probably responsible for the hexose-rich composition observed for many Brassicaceae nectars.},

We studied 20 domestic cats to investigate whether they could recognize their owners by using voices that called out the subjects’ names, with a habituation–dishabituation method. While the owner was out of the cat’s sight, we played three different strangers’ voices serially, followed by the owner’s voice. We recorded the cat’s reactions to the voices and categorized them into six behavioral categories. In addition, ten naive raters rated the cats’ response magnitudes. The cats responded to human voices not by communicative behavior (vocalization and tail movement), but by orienting behavior (ear movement and head movement). This tendency did not change even when they were called by their owners. Of the 20 cats, 15 demonstrated a lower response magnitude to the third voice than to the first voice. These habituated cats showed a significant rebound in response to the subsequent presentation of their owners’ voices. This result indicates that cats are able to use vocal cues alone to distinguish between humans.},

	abstract = {The decision making behaviors of humans and animals adapt and then satisfy an "operant matching law" in certain type of tasks. This was first pointed out by Herrnstein in his foraging experiments on pigeons. The matching law has been one landmark for elucidating the underlying processes of decision making and its learning in the brain. An interesting question is whether decisions are made deterministically or probabilistically. Conventional learning models of the matching law are based on the latter idea; they assume that subjects learn choice probabilities of respective alternatives and decide stochastically with the probabilities. However, it is unknown whether the matching law can be accounted for by a deterministic strategy or not. To answer this question, we propose several deterministic Bayesian decision making models that have certain incorrect beliefs about an environment. We claim that a simple model produces behavior satisfying the matching law in static settings of a foraging task but not in dynamic settings. We found that the model that has a belief that the environment is volatile works well in the dynamic foraging task and exhibits undermatching, which is a slight deviation from the matching law observed in many experiments. This model also demonstrates the double-exponential reward history dependency of a choice and a heavier-tailed run-length distribution, as has recently been reported in experiments on monkeys.},

Nevertheless, when given a choice we see that individuals can clearly distinguish between rewards. Here we develop the logic of using responses to two-choice problems as a derivative function of perceived reward, and utilize this model to examine honey bee perception of nectar quality. Measuring the derivative allows us to deduce the perceived reward function. The derivative function of the perceived reward equation gives the rate of change of the reward perceived for each reward value. This approach depends on presenting free-flying foragers with a series of two different rewards presented simultaneously (i.e., two-choice, binomial tests). We also examine how honey bees integrate information from a range of reward qualities to formulate a functional response. Results suggest that honey bees overestimate higher quality rewards and that direct comparison is an important step in the integration of information from a range of rewards.},

	abstract = {A comparison between bat-pollinated plant assemblages at two sites in different altitudinal ranges covered by the Atlantic rainforest in southeastern Brazil is presented. The lowlands (5–90 m) harbour ten plant species in seven families, pollinated mostly by three glossophagine bat species. The highlands (1540–1600 m) harbour seven plant species in five families, pollinated by a single species of glossophagine. Bromeliads account for about 30\% of the bat-pollinated species at each assemblage. Tube and brush shapes prevail in the flowers at both sites. Corolla lengths averaged 26.8 and 37.2 mm, sugar concentrations in nectar averaged 15.0 and 18.1\%, and nectar volumes averaged 150.8 and 167.0 μl in the lowland and highland assemblages, respectively. The flowers are pollinated mostly by glossophagine bats during hovering visits, and the plants are visited in the trap-line foraging pattern. The plants bloom annually and both assemblages show a staggered continual flowering pattern. Flowering seasonality was found at both sites, with flowering clustering in the drier season at the lowland site and in the wetter season at the highland site. The ratio between bat-pollinated and hummingbird-pollinated species is 0.24 at the lowland site and 0.23 at the highland one. These similar values indicate that additional studies on bat- and bird-pollinated assemblages are merited at other Atlantic rainforest sites.Copyright 1999 Annals of Botany Company},

Here, we test this hypothesis by investigating the genetic basis of pollinator discrimination in two closely related species of monkeyflowers that differ in their major pollinators. This system provides a unique opportunity to investigate the genetic architecture of adaptation and speciation because floral traits that confer pollinator specificity also contribute to premating reproductive isolation. We asked: (i) What floral traits cause pollinator discrimination among plant species? and (ii) What is the genetic basis of these traits? We examined these questions by using data obtained from a large-scale field experiment where genetic markers were employed to determine the genetic basis of pollinator visitation. Observations of F2 hybrids produced by crossing bee-pollinated Mimulus lewisii with hummingbird-pollinated Mimulus cardinalis revealed that bees preferred large flowers low in anthocyanin and carotenoid pigments, whereas hummingbirds favored nectar-rich flowers high in anthocyanins. An allele that increases petal carotenoid concentration reduced bee visitation by 80\%, whereas an allele that increases nectar production doubled hummingbird visitation. These results suggest that genes of large effect on pollinator preference have contributed to floral evolution and premating reproductive isolation in these monkeyflowers. This work contributes to growing evidence that adaptation and reproductive isolation may often involve major genes.},

Choice mechanisms can be hierarchical (if alternatives are assigned to categories by their similarity and choice is between categories) or simultaneous (if options enter the choice process individually, each with its own value). The latter, although simpler, can lead to counterintuitive outcomes because expressed preference between options depends not only on the kinds of options present but also on the number of exemplars within each kind, so that decision makers have a higher probability of picking an option of a given class when exemplars in this class are common. Higher preference for commoner options has indeed been shown in humans, and if present in animals, it would affect many choice domains, including prey and mate choice. We studied the problem using starlings making risk-sensitive choices. Subjects chose between a risky option and 1 (in binary choices) or 2 (in trinary choices) fixed options that were identifiable as distinct but were identical in reward rate and had no variance. Preference between the risky and each fixed option was unaltered between binary and trinary contexts, but subjects chose a higher proportion of the fixed kind when this was represented by 2 rather than 1 distinct food sources. This means subjects were objectively risk prone in binary and risk averse in trinary contexts. These results fit accounts based on learning principles, but contradict the expectations of functional models of choice, including risk-sensitivity theory.},

	abstract = {. In this paper we emphasize the role of pollinator perception and decision-making processes in mediating floral nectar distribution strategies. Since pollinator choice behavior is guided by how the pollinator perceives and evaluates floral rewards, we hypothesize that plants have evolved strategies that maximize their perceived profitability, through pollinator cognition-mediated coevolution. We focus on two classes of cognitive phenomena, context-dependent evaluations and risk-sensitivity. These phenomena are of interest to psychologists and biologists. Our paper is an attempt to show the value of cross-disciplinary exchange of theories and ideas. A review of the ecology literature suggests that pollinators evaluate variability in nectar volume in proportion to the mean, and thus choice behavior is guided by the coefficient of variation (standard deviation/mean) of the distribution. This functional relationship is predicted by Weber's law, which describes a wide range of psychophysical phenomena. Simulations show that this phenomenon also affects how pollinators perceive skewed nectar distributions. Cognition-mediated coevolution theory should be a fruitful approach to understanding the evolution of pollinator-plant interactions.},

	abstract = {Honeybee workers (foragers) are risk averse to variability in volume of reward when measured by conditioning of the proboscis extension response, and the level of risk aversion depends on the coefficient of variation of the variable distribution. Since drones do not forage on flowers, they may not have been under selection for risk-sensitive choice behaviour. We compared risk sensitivity of workers and drones and their ability to discriminate between the reward volumes used in the risk sensitivity experiments. Both castes discriminated better between 0 and 0.4 μl than between 0.4 and 1.2 μl, consistent with Weber's law of relative discrimination. Workers discriminated between both volume pairs better than drones, and workers showed greater risk aversion than drones. This is the first demonstration of caste-specific differences in risk sensitivity. These differences do not appear to be the result of differences in energy budgets, since both castes were on positive energy budgets. Levels of risk aversion were consistent with the coefficient of variation model. We calculated the relative associative strengths of subjects to the reward volumes from their choice proportions in the discrimination tests. The relative associative strengths of workers were greater than those of drones, and in both castes the relative associative strength of 0.4 μl relative to 0 μl was greater than that of 1.2 μl relative to 0.4 μl. Owing to Jensen's inequality, the decreasing functions of differences in relative associative strengths could explain differences in degree of risk aversion between the castes.

Fifteen bees were given binary choices between artificial flowers that varied in depth and in volume of sucrose-water delivered. Three bees violated weak stochastic transitivity, under an assumption about the order in which the flowers ranked along a utility scale; they preferred flower A to flower B, B to C, C to D, but D to A. These bees also violated strong stochastic transitivity, which focuses on the strength rather than the direction of preference. An intransitive pattern of choice supports the hypothesis of 'comparative' evaluation of flowers, where options are compared along their different dimensions, each dimension separately. Intransitivities cannot be explained by an 'absolute' model, where each option is evaluated independently and assigned a fixed value (utility). Twelve of the bees made choices that were consistent with both absolute and comparative models of decision making. In light of the above results it is suggested that the assumption that animals employ an absolute method of decision making be reconsidered, and perhaps supplemented with a comparative account. Possible evolutionary advantages of comparative evaluations are discussed.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

I analyzed a large set of published studies to test whether these differences in risk-sensitivity may be influenced by the coefficient of variation (s.d./mean) of the variable reward and by the presence of empty rewards. The coefficient of variation had a strong effect on the strength of risk-sensitivity among studies with nectarivores, both invertebrates and vertebrates. The effect was not significant for studies with non-nectarivores, but these studies included only a limited range of coefficients of variation, and risk-sensitivity in these studies was based on fewer subjects per experimental condition than in studies of nectarivores. The presence of empty rewards had no effect on the strength of risk-sensitivity. The apparent effect of empty rewards seems to be an artifact of the tendency of distributions that include zero rewards to have larger coefficients of variation than distributions that do not include zero rewards. I introduce the {CV} model, a simple descriptive model that accounts for a large proportion of the variability in levels of risk-sensitivity among experiments. My analysis resolves the apparent discrepancies among studies that report risk-sensitivity and risk-indifference. It is necessary to control for the magnitude of the coefficient of variation when testing risk-sensitivity under different conditions (e.g., energy budgets). A successful descriptive model of risk-sensitive choice behavior is useful for guiding future research both in ecology and in the underlying mechanism of cognitive processes.},

	abstract = {Background There are few clinical tools that assess decision-making under risk. Tests that characterize sensitivity and bias in decisions between prospects varying in magnitude and probability of gain may provide insights in conditions with anomalous reward-related behaviour. Objective We designed a simple test of how subjects integrate information about the magnitude and the probability of reward, which can determine discriminative thresholds and choice bias in decisions under risk. Design/Methods Twenty subjects were required to choose between two explicitly described prospects, one with higher probability but lower magnitude of reward than the other, with the difference in expected value between the two prospects varying from 3 to 23\%. Results Subjects showed a mean threshold sensitivity of 43\% difference in expected value. Regarding choice bias, there was a ‘risk premium’ of 38\%, indicating a tendency to choose higher probability over higher reward. An analysis using prospect theory showed that this risk premium is the predicted outcome of hypothesized non-linearities in the subjective perception of reward value and probability. Conclusions This simple test provides a robust measure of discriminative value thresholds and biases in decisions under risk. Prospect theory can also make predictions about decisions when subjective perception of reward or probability is anomalous, as may occur in populations with dopaminergic or striatal dysfunction, such as Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia.},

	abstract = {Darwin's claim ‘that the difference in mind between man and the higher animals … is certainly one of degree and not of kind’ is at the core of the comparative study of cognition. Recent research provides unprecedented support for Darwin's claim as well as new reasons to question it, stimulating new theories of human cognitive uniqueness. This article compares and evaluates approaches to such theories. Some prominent theories propose sweeping domain-general characterizations of the difference in cognitive capabilities and/or mechanisms between adult humans and other animals. Dual-process theories for some cognitive domains propose that adult human cognition shares simple basic processes with that of other animals while additionally including slower-developing and more explicit uniquely human processes. These theories are consistent with a modular account of cognition and the ‘core knowledge’ account of children's cognitive development. A complementary proposal is that human infants have unique social and/or cognitive adaptations for uniquely human learning. A view of human cognitive architecture as a mosaic of unique and species-general modular and domain-general processes together with a focus on uniquely human developmental mechanisms is consistent with modern evolutionary-developmental biology and suggests new questions for comparative research.},

Our hypotheses are based largely on a connection between fast–slow behavioural types ({BTs}; e.g. boldness, aggressiveness, exploration tendency) and cognitive speed–accuracy trade-offs. We also discuss connections between {BTs}, cognition and ecologically important aspects of decision-making, including sampling, impulsivity, risk sensitivity and choosiness.

	abstract = {I review the basic rationale for risk-sensitive foraging, and present a few of the most common expressions of risk-sensitivity theory. A simple heuristic, the energy-budget rule, and the z-score model are explained. These functional models of risk sensitivity assume or explicitly model fitness as a nonlinear function of an animal's energy state. For such nonlinear relationships, Jensen's inequality predicts that the fitness realized by an animal with a more constant energy state may be higher or lower than the fitness resulting from a variable energy state with the same mean, depending on the shape of the fitness function. Predictive functional models of behavior, like the energy-budget rule and the z-score model, depend on specific features of the function relating energy state to fitness, which may or may not be general features for most organisms. While behavioral ecologist have studied the functional significance of animal responses to variation in foraging rewards, psychologists have long studied the psychological mechanisms by which preferences for variable or constant rewards are expressed. Jensen's inequality is applied here too; psychologists propose nonlinearities in the perception and processing of information. The growing number of different relationships that might account for risk-sensitive behavior is a potential source of confusion. I advocate “returning to the basics,” i.e., that hypotheses to explain risksensitive behavior should specify precisely the assumed nonlinear relationships.},

	abstract = {Long-term memory ({LTM}) formation usually requires repeated, spaced learning events and is achieved by the synthesis of specific proteins. Other memory forms require a single learning experience and are independent of protein synthesis. We investigated in two closely related parasitic wasp species, Cotesia glomerata and Cotesia rubecula, whether natural differences in foraging behaviour are correlated with differences in {LTM} acquisition and formation. These parasitic wasp species lay their eggs in young caterpillars of pierid butterflies and can learn to associate plant odours with a successful egg laying experience on caterpillars on the odour-producing plant. We used a classical conditioning set-up, while interfering with {LTM} formation through translation or transcription inhibitors. We show here that C. rubecula formed {LTM} after three spaced learning trials, whereas C. glomerata required only a single trial for {LTM} formation. After three spaced learning trials, {LTM} formation was complete within 4 h in C. glomerata, whereas in C. rubecula, {LTM} formation took 3 days. Linking neurobiology with ecology, we argue that this species-specific difference in {LTM} acquisition and formation is adaptive given the extreme differences in both the number of foraging decisions of the two wasp species and in the spatial distributions of their respective hosts in nature.},

One approach is to reconstruct the history of both floral traits and pollination systems to determine if floral trait change is spurred by shifts in pollinators. Looking across multiple shifts, it is also possible to test for significant correlations between floral evolution and pollinators using parsimony, likelihood and Bayesian methods for discrete characters or using statistical comparative methods for continuous characters. Evolutionary shifts in pollinators and floral traits may cause changes in diversification rates, and new methods are available for simultaneously studying character evolution and diversification rates. Relatively few studies have yet used formal comparative methods to elucidate how pollinators affect floral evolution across the phylogeny, and fruitful directions for future applications are discussed.},

We explored the relationship between host learning and reproduction in the cabbage white butterfly, Pieris rapae. The cabbage white female is innately biased to search for common green hosts but can learn to search for rare red hosts. Host learning was shown previously to vary among full-sibling families and to incur costs in terms of host search efficiency and brain size. In the present study, we show that butterflies from full-sib families with relatively better learning performance on red hosts tend to emerge as adults with relatively fewer and less-developed eggs. We also used methoprene, a juvenile hormone mimic, to advance reproduction in female cabbage whites. We found that methoprene-treated butterflies improved host-finding ability less with experience, relative to controls, providing independent evidence of a link between learning and timing of reproduction. Finally, we show that the learning experience itself is associated with additional decreases in lifetime fecundity. These results support a range of theoretical and comparative studies highlighting the importance of fitness tradeoffs in the evolution of learning and cognition.},

	abstract = {Summary. We consider the problem of comparing complex hierarchical models in which the number of parameters is not clearly defined. Using an information theoretic argument we derive a measure {pD} for the effective number of parameters in a model as the difference between the posterior mean of the deviance and the deviance at the posterior means of the parameters of interest. In general {pD} approximately corresponds to the trace of the product of Fisher's information and the posterior covariance, which in normal models is the trace of the ‘hat’ matrix projecting observations onto fitted values. Its properties in exponential families are explored. The posterior mean deviance is suggested as a Bayesian measure of fit or adequacy, and the contributions of individual observations to the fit and complexity can give rise to a diagnostic plot of deviance residuals against leverages. Adding {pD} to the posterior mean deviance gives a deviance information criterion for comparing models, which is related to other information criteria and has an approximate decision theoretic justification. The procedure is illustrated in some examples, and comparisons are drawn with alternative Bayesian and classical proposals. Throughout it is emphasized that the quantities required are trivial to compute in a Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis.},

Some species visited are believed to be pollinated principally by perching birds, lepidopterans, and bees, however. We measured sugar composition (\% fructose, glucose, and sucrose), daily secretion rates, and sugar concentration. In general, sugar compositions of all hummingbird nectars were found to be highly clustered toward the high-sucrose end of the composition spectrum and not significantly different from sugar compositions of other hummingbird nectar assemblages from northwestern Mexico and the southwestern United States. Significant correlations were detected between elevation and the percentage of fructose and of sucrose in the nectar, with the fructose percent positive and the sucrose negative. These correlations were found to be due to both elevation and hummingbird-group effects. Daily secretion rate and sugar concentration were both negatively correlated with elevation. Discriminant analysis indicated that nectar sugar concentration and daily secretion rates together could usually predict whether a species was pollinated by hermit (Phaethorninae) or nonhermit (Trochilinae) hummingbirds and could often predict which eco-morphological group of nonhermits.},

Furthermore, knowing the slope allows one to compare, across studies, thresholds that were obtained at different performance criterion levels. Unfortunately, the empirical validation of psychometric function slope estimates is hindered by the bewildering variety of slope measures that are in use. The present article provides conversion formulas for the most popular cases, including the logistic, Weibull, Quick, cumulative normal, and hyperbolic tangent functions as analytic representations, in both linear and log coordinates and to different log bases, the practical decilog unit, the empirically based interquartile range measure of slope, and slope in a d' representation of performance.},

	abstract = {Most hummingbirds and some species of nectar bats hover while feeding on floral nectar. While doing so, they achieve some of the highest mass-specific values among vertebrates. This is made possible by enhanced functional capacities of various elements of the ‘O2 transport cascade’, the pathway of O2 from the external environment to muscle mitochondria. Fasted hummingbirds and nectar bats fly with respiratory quotients ({RQs}; ) of ∼0.7, indicating that fat fuels flight in the fasted state. During repeated hover-feeding on dietary sugar, {RQ} values progressively climb to ∼1.0, indicating a shift from fat to carbohydrate oxidation. Stable carbon isotope experiments reveal that recently ingested sugar directly fuels ∼80 and 95\% of energy metabolism in hover-feeding nectar bats and hummingbirds, respectively. We name the pathway of carbon flux from flowers, through digestive and cardiovascular systems, muscle membranes and into mitochondria the ‘sugar oxidation cascade’. O2 and sugar oxidation cascades operate in parallel and converge in muscle mitochondria. Foraging behavior that favours the oxidation of dietary sugar avoids the inefficiency of synthesizing fat from sugar and breaking down fat to fuel foraging. Sugar oxidation yields a higher P/O ratio ({ATP} made per O atom consumed) than fat oxidation, thus requiring lower hovering per unit mass. We propose that dietary sugar is a premium fuel for flight in nectarivorous, flying animals.},

We trained foragers to a feeder located 1.2 km from each of four colonies. On average foragers carried 12.7\% greater volume of fuel, equivalent to 30.2\% more glucose when foraging on a variable source (a random sequence of 0.5, 1.5 and 2.5 M sucrose solution, average sucrose content 1.5 M) than when forging on a consistent source (constant 1.5 M sucrose solution). Our findings complement an earlier study that showed that foragers decrease their fuel load as they become more familiar with a foraging place. We suggest that honey bee foragers are risk sensitive, and carry more fuel to minimize the risk of starvation in the field when a foraging trip is perceived as being risky, either because the forager is unfamiliar with the foraging site, or because the forage available at a familiar site offers variable rewards.},

	abstract = {Trophallaxis by honeybee foragers was studied under the experimental conditions of an arena. The behaviour of pairs of bees, one (donor) fed with 50-\&mgr;l sucrose solutions and another unfed recipient, was analysed as a function of the sucrose concentration, the concentration at constant viscosity (kept constant by adding tylose, an inert polysaccharide), and of the viscosity of a 30\% sucrose solution. By increasing the concentration of solutions, the rate at which the solution was transferred to recipient bees (transfer rate of solution, in \&mgr;l/s) increased up to a maximum value for 30\% sucrose solution, and decreased beyond this concentration (concentration experiment). At constant viscosity, no modulation was observed for the lower sugar concentration range (10-30\%), while the transfer rate of solution clearly increased beyond 30\% (concentration experiment at constant viscosity). For the 30\% sucrose solution, the transfer rate decreased with increasing viscosity (viscosity experiment). If only the sucrose compound is comparatively analysed, the transfer rate of sucrose (in mg/s) increased similarly in the first two experiments. These results give behavioural evidence suggesting that donor bees are capable of modulating the trophallactic food transfer as related to the sucrose concentrations carried into their crops within a considerable wide range, but viscosity prevents it. It also suggests that trophallactic transfer rate does not depend on abdominal volume, for even when all donor bees attained similar loads (50 \&mgr;l), transfer rate of solution increased along with the offered sucrose concentration. Results are discussed in relation to the information exchange performed in the foraging context displayed by foragers. Copyright 1999 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

	url = {http://edoc.ub.uni-muenchen.de/5566/},
	abstract = {In der vorliegenden Arbeit wurde das Nahrungssuchverhalten der in der Neotropis verbreiteten Blumenfledermausart Glossophaga commissarisi untersucht. Die Tiere ernähren sich zu einem großen Teil von Nektar, den sie, ähnlich wie Kolibris, im Schwirrflug aus Blüten speziell adaptierter, chiropterophiler Pflanzen entnehmen. Weil die räumliche Verteilung dieser Pflanzen im tropischen Regenwald sehr unregelmäßig und zerstreut ist, legen die Tiere auf der Suche nach Nahrung enorm lange Flugstrecken zurück und die von ihnen umgesetzten Energiemengen sind extrem hoch. Die Lebensweise der Tiere erscheint daher stark limitiert von energetischen Grenzbedingungen. Die individuelle Fitness einer Blumenfledermaus hängt ganz entscheidend von der Effizienz ihres Nahrungssuchverhaltens ab. In den letzten Jahren haben sich daher zunehmend Arbeiten mit der Energetik und dem Nahrungssuchverhalten von Blumenfledermäusen beschäftigt, hauptsächlich wurden dabei Laborversuche unter der Anwendung von künstlichen Blüten durchgeführt - eine individuenspezifische Beobachtung der Tiere im Freiland war bisher durch ihre nächtliche Lebensweise und der schnellen Fortbewegung in den gleichzeitig schwer zugänglichen Regenwaldhabitaten kaum möglich.
Mit dem hier vorgestellten Kunstblütensystem habe ich einen neuen Ansatz gefunden, Nahrung suchende Fledermäuse im Freiland zu beobachten. Dabei wurde eine große Zahl künstlicher, computergesteuerter Blüten im natürlichen Lebensraum der Tiere großflächig ausgebracht. Die Blüten waren mit einem Zuckerwasservorrat versehen und konnten dadurch genau definierte Mengen von "Nektar" an besuchende Tiere abgeben. Die Detektion der besuchenden Fledermäuse wurde mit Hilfe von Infrarot-Lichtschranken vorgenommen. Zusätzlich waren die Tiere mit Transponderhalsbändern individuell markiert und die Blüten mit entsprechenden Lesegeräten ausgestattet, so dass bei jedem Blütenbesuch eine Identifikation des Besuchers vorgenommen wurde. Die resultierenden Daten enthalten individuelle, zeitlich und örtlich präzise Informationen über die Suchrouten, die die Tiere im Freiland zurücklegen. 
Mit dem künstlichen Blütenfeld wurden unterschiedliche energetische und kognitive Fragestellungen zum Nahrungssuchverhalten von nektarivoren Fledermäusen untersucht:
Die Zeit- und Energiebudgets der beteiligten Tiere an den künstlichen Blüten konnten präzise bestimmt und verglichen werden mit entsprechenden Angaben aus früheren Arbeiten, die mit anderen Verfahren ermittelt wurden.
Aus den individuellen Besuchsdaten wurden außerdem die von den Tieren bevorzugten Fluggeschwindigkeiten ermittelt und mit den Vorhersagen von aerodynamischen Modellen verglichen. Außerdem beschreibt die Arbeit die individuelle räumliche Verteilung der Tiere, die sich bei stabiler Ressourcenverteilung auf der Untersuchungsfläche einstellte. 
Die Größe und die Konstanz der von den Individuen besuchten Areale und die Anzahl der von ihnen besuchten Blüten werden bestimmt und diskutiert. 
Das Erlernen verschiedener räumlicher Nahrungsverteilungsmuster durch die Tiere in Umwelten unterschiedlicher Variabilität ist Inhalt eines weiteren Abschnittes.
Die in diesem Experiment aufgezeichneten Bewegungsmuster der Tiere wurden individuell analysiert, um die große Variabilität der Suchstrategien zwischen den Individuen darzustellen und zeitlich und räumliche angepasste Suchstrategien der Tiere zu charakterisieren und deren Effizienz abzuschätzen.},

	abstract = {Trapline foraging—repealed sequential visits to a series of feeding locations—presents interesting problems seldom treated in foraging models. Work on traplining is hampered by the lack of statistical, operational approaches for detecting its existence and measuring its strength. We propose several statistical procedures, illustrating them with records of interplant flight sequences by bumble bees visiting penstemon flowers. An asymmetry test detects deviations from binomial expectation in the directionality of visits between pairs of plants. Several tests compare data from one bee to another frequencies of visits to plants and frequencies of departures to particular destinations are compared using contingency tables; similarities of repeated sequences within bees are compared to those between bees by means of sequence alignment and Mantel tests. We also compared observed movement patterns to those generated by null models designed to represent realistic foraging by non-traplining bees, examining: temporal patterns of the bee's spatial displacement from its starting point using spectral analysis; the variance of return times to particular plants; and the sequence alignment of repeated cycles within sequences. We discuss the different indications and the relative strengths of these approaches. Krj words: asymmetry test, Bombus, foraging, Mantel test, null model, Ptnsttwum, sequence, trapline.

Studies often focus on a subset of high-performing subjects, sometimes viewing evidence from a single individual as sufficient to demonstrate the cognitive capacity of a species. We argue that the emphasis on demonstrating species-level cognitive capacities detracts from the value of individual variation in understanding cognitive development and evolution. We consider developmental and evolutionary interpretations of individual variation and use meta-analyses of data from published studies to examine predictors of individual performance. We show that reliance on small sample sizes precludes robust conclusions about individual abilities as well as inter- and intraspecific differences. We advocate standardization of experimental protocols and pooling of data between laboratories to improve statistical rigour. Our analyses show that cognitive performance is influenced by age, sex, rearing conditions and previous experience. These effects limit the validity of comparative analyses unless developmental histories are taken into account, and complicate attempts to understand how cognitive traits are expressed and selected under natural conditions. Further understanding of cognitive evolution requires efforts to elucidate the heritability of cognitive traits and establish whether elevated cognitive performance confers fitness advantages in nature.},

This paper reviews the theoretical side of decision-making under uncertainty, particularly with regard to unknown risk (ambiguity). We use simple models to show that, irrespective of pay-offs, whether it is optimal to bias probability estimates depends upon how those estimates have been generated. In particular, if estimates have been calculated in a Bayesian framework with a sensible prior, it is best to use unbiased estimates. We review the extent of evidence for and against viewing animals (including humans) as Bayesian decision-makers. We pay particular attention to the Ellsberg Paradox, a classic result from experimental economics, in which human subjects appear to deviate from optimal decision-making by demonstrating an apparent aversion to ambiguity in a choice between two options with equal expected rewards. The paradox initially seems to be an example where decision-making estimates are biased relative to the Bayesian optimum. We discuss the extent to which the Bayesian paradigm might be applied to the evolution of decision-makers and how the Ellsberg Paradox may, with a deeper understanding, be resolved.},

Numerous empirical findings can be explained by assuming that animals use some mechanism similar to the Rescorla-Wagner learning rule, which is a relatively simple and highly general method of updating the associative strength between different stimuli. However, the Rescorla-Wagner rule is often not optimal, which raises the question of why a rule with such properties should have evolved. We consider the evolution of learning rules in a simple environment where there exists an optimal rule of similar complexity to the Rescorla-Wagner rule. We show that because the Rescorla-Wagner rule is less sensitive to changes in its parameters than the optimal rule, there is a wider range of parameter values over which the rule structure is initially viable. Consequently, the Rescorla-Wagner rule can be favoured by natural selection, ahead of other rules which are more accurate.},

Empirical studies have shown that animals violate regularity but this has not been understood from a theoretical perspective, such decisions have therefore been labelled as irrational. Here, I use models of state-dependent behaviour to demonstrate that choices can violate regularity even when behavioural strategies are optimal. I also show that the range of conditions over which regularity should be violated can be larger when options do not always persist into the future. Consequently, utility theory—based on axioms, including transitivity, regularity and the independence of irrelevant alternatives—is undermined, because even alternatives that are never chosen by an animal (in its current state) can be relevant to a decision.},

	abstract = {Neotropical rainforests support guilds of nectar feeding bats (Phyllostomidae: Glossophaginae) with up to six coexisting species. To analyse guild structure and mechanisms of coexistence in a Costa Rican tropical lowland rainforest, the resource use and morphology of bats were compared to the energetic characteristics of preferred nectar resources and their spatio-temporal distribution. The relative abundance of nectar-feeding bats was determined from mistnet captures over 26 months. Food items were identified by analysis of pollen loads and faecal samples. Phenology, flower density and nectar sugar content of resource plants permitted quantitative estimations of resource availability expressed as energy density ({kJ} ha−1 day−1) throughout the annual cycle. Four glossophagine bat species co-occurred at La Selva: two permanent residents (Glossophaga commissarisi, Hylonycteris underwoodi) and two seasonal species (Lichonycteris obscura, Lonchophylla robusta) that were found in small numbers during a period of high nectar availability. The two resident species differed in their abundance and in their temporal feeding strategies. After the main flowering peak, the common G. commissarisi shifted to a more frugivorous diet, while the rarer H. underwoodi fed on the few remaining bat-flowers. Resource plant species differed in their energy density by up to two orders of magnitude. Hylonycteris underwoodi visited more often plant species with a low energy yield than G. commissarisi. Because of its smaller body size and a wing morphology that promotes fast flight, H. underwoodi appears to be better adapted to low and scattered nectar resource levels. The two seasonal species differed greatly in body mass, which suggests different strategies for high-quality resource tracking. Large body mass in Lonchophylla robusta provides an energy buffer that permits daily commuting flights between a permanent roost and profitable foraging areas, while the small Lichonycteris obscura seems to track resources nomadically. It is proposed that energy density may be a major niche dimension that restricts access of species to certain habitats and that may profoundly influence the structure of nectar-feeding bat guilds.},

In order to develop theories of actual decision making under uncertainty, we need new methodologies that account for how human (sentient) actors often manage uncertain situations “well enough.” Some possibly helpful methodologies, drawing on digital science, focus on the role of emotions in determining people's choices; others examine how people construct narratives that enable them to act; still others combine qualitative with quantitative data.},

This version, called cumulative prospect theory, applies to uncertain as well as to risky prospects with any number of outcomes, and it allows different weighting functions for gains and for losses. Two principles, diminishing sensitivity and loss aversion, are invoked to explain the characteristic curvature of the value function and the weighting functions. A review of the experimental evidence and the results of a new experiment confirm a distinctive fourfold pattern of risk attitudes: risk aversion for gains and risk seeking for losses of high probability; risk seeking for gains and risk aversion for losses of low probability.

	abstract = {1. Quantifying individual heterogeneity in plasticity is becoming common in studies of evolutionary ecology, climate change ecology and animal personality. Individual variation in reaction norms is typically quantified using random effects in a mixed modelling framework. However, little is known about what sampling effort and design provide sufficient accuracy, precision and power.2. I developed ‘odprism’, an easy-to-use software package for the statistical language R, which can be used to investigate the accuracy, precision and power of random regression models for various types of data structures. Moreover, I conducted simulations to derive rules-of-thumb for four design decisions that biologists often face.3. First, I investigated the trade-off between sampling many individuals a few times versus sampling few individuals often. Generally, at least 40 individuals should be sampled with a total sample size of at least 1000 to obtain accurate and precise estimates of individual variation in elevation and slopes of linear reaction norms and their correlation. Contrasting a previous recommendation, it is worthwhile to bias the ratio of number of individuals over replicates towards sampling more individuals.4. Second, I considered how the range of environmental conditions over which individuals are sampled affects the optimal sampling strategy. I show that when all individuals experience the same conditions during a sampling event, sampling each individual only twice should be strictly avoided.5. Third, I examined the case where the number of replicates per individual is constrained by their lifespan, as is common when sampling annual traits in the wild. I show that for a given sampling effort, it is much easier to detect individual variation in reaction norms for long-lived than for short-lived species.6. Fourth, I investigated the performance of random regression models when studying traits under selection. Reassuringly, directional viability selection barely caused any bias in estimates of variance components.7. Random regression models are inherently data hungry, and reviewing the literature shows that particularly behavioural studies have low sampling effort. Therefore, the software and rules-of-thumbs I identified for designing reaction-norm studies should help researchers make more informed choices, which likely improve the reliability and interpretation of plasticity studies.},

Recent reports of transitive-like behaviors in non-human animals have prompted a flourishing empirical and theoretical search for the mechanism(s) that may mediate this ability in non-humans. In this paper, I begin by describing the transitive inference tasks customarily used with non-human animals and then review the empirical findings. Transitive inference has been demonstrated in a wide variety of species, and the signature effects that usually accompany transitive inference in humans (the serial position effect and the symbolic distance effect) have also been found in non-humans. I then critically analyze the most prominent models of this ability in non-human animals. Some models are cognitive, proposing for instance that animals use the rules of formal logic or form mental representations of the premises to solve the task, others are based on associative mechanisms such as value transfer and reinforcement and non-reinforcement. Overall, I argue that the reinforcement-based models are in a much better empirical and theoretical position. Hence, transitive inference in non-human animals should be considered a property of reinforcement history rather than of inferential processes. I finalize by shedding some light on some promising lines of research.},

This review surveys the current status of several areas of cat cognition research including perception, object permanence, memory, physical causality, quantity and time discrimination, cats' sensitivity to human cues, vocal recognition and communication, attachment bonds, personality, and cognitive health. Although interest in cat cognition is growing, we still have a long way to go until we have an inclusive body of research on the subject. Therefore, this review also identifies areas where future research must be conducted. In addition to the scientific value of future work in this area, future research on cat cognition could have an important influence on the management and welfare of pet and free-roaming cats, leading to improved human-cat interactions.},

Twenty compounds belonging to four different chemical substance classes were tested, both in the laboratory and in the field. In the laboratory, the bats (Glossophaga soricina) approached odour sources spontaneously and without preceding experience. Without ever receiving any reward they preferred the scent of a sulphur-containing compound, dimethyl disulphide, to several other odour components emitted by bat-pollinated flowers, and to scentless controls. In the field, at La Selva station in the tropical lowland rain forest of Costa Rica, G. commissarisi were attracted by two sulphur-containing compounds, dimethyl disulphide and 2,4-dithiapentane, to visit artificial flowers filled with sugar water. Thus, in nectarivorous bats the sense of smell obviously plays an important role in searching for and localising food sources, and even single components of the scent bouquets of bat-pollinated flowers are attractive. The preference for sulphur-containing odours seems to be innate.},

We analysed whether the main characteristics that define nectar in energetic terms, that is, rate of production (flow of solution), sucrose concentration and rate of sucrose production (sucrose flow) influence trophallactic behaviour. Individual bees trained to feed at a regulated-flow feeder offering sucrose solution were captured once the foraging visit was complete and placed in an acrylic arena with a recipient bee that had not been fed. The rate at which liquid was transferred during the subsequent trophallactic contact (transfer rate) was analysed as a function of the different solution flows and sucrose concentrations offered at the feeder. A relationship was found between transfer rate during trophallaxis and the flow of solution previously presented at the feeder. This relationship was independent of sucrose concentration when above a certain threshold value (ca. 22\% weight on weight). We also analysed whether the rate of sucrose deliverance of the food source (sucrose flow) influenced the rate at which the solution was transferred. No clear relationship was found between the rate of sucrose deliverance during trophallactic events (sucrose transfer rate) and the sucrose flow presented at the feeder. The possibility that trophallaxis could be a communication channel through which quantitative information on food source profitability is transmitted among hivemates is discussed.

	abstract = {Decision makers are often assumed to assign stable fitness-based values to foraging options. Under this assumption, the tendency to prefer the more valuable of two simultaneously available options should be transitive. For example, if option a is preferred when paired with b, and b is preferred when paired with c, then a should be preferred when paired with c. According to the principle of strong stochastic transitivity, the preference for a over c should be at least as strong as the stronger of the other two preferences (i.e., p(a,c)≥max[p(a,b), p(b,c)]). Gray jays (Perisoreus canadensis) collecting food for storage violated this principle, and failed to support even weaker forms of transitivity. All subjects preferred option a (one raisin, 28 cm into a tube) over b (two raisins, 42 cm), and b over c (three raisins, 56 cm), but none of the subjects preferred a over c. Such paradoxical preferences are often interpreted as evidence for simple heuristics rather than complex decision mechanisms. According to bounded rationality, intransitive choice is a suboptimal byproduct of heuristics that usually perform well in real-world situations. Alternatively, intransitive choice could be a byproduct of selection favoring a complex decision process involving context-dependent assessment of each the fitness-related value of each option. From this perspective, the decision maker's subjective valuation of each option is not fixed, but rather depends on the context (i.e., the specific pairing of options). In the experiment, the subjective value of option a was apparently lower in option set \{a,c\} than in \{a,b\}. A model of context-dependent choice is used to explore conditions under which adaptive choice based on a complex decision process can lead to intransitivity.},

To realize cumulative cultural evolution, social and individual learning should be performed in this order in one’s life. However, it is not clear whether such a learning schedule can evolve by the maximization of individual fitness. Here we study optimal allocation of lifetime to learning and exploitation in a two-stage life history model under a constant environment. We show that the learning schedule by which high cultural level is achieved through cumulative cultural evolution is unlikely to evolve as a result of the maximization of individual fitness, if there exists a trade-off between the time spent in learning and the time spent in exploiting the knowledge that has been learned in earlier stages of one’s life. Collapse of a fully developed culture is predicted by a game-theoretical analysis where individuals behave selfishly, e.g., less learning and more exploiting. The present study suggests that such factors as group selection, the ability of learning-while-working (“on the job training”), or environmental fluctuation might be important in the realization of rapid and cumulative cultural evolution that is observed in humans.},

In the model, slow recurrent excitation and feedback inhibition produce attractor dynamics that amplify the difference between conflicting inputs and generates a binary choice. The model is shown to account for salient characteristics of the observed decision-correlated neural activity, as well as the animal's psychometric function and reaction times. These results suggest that recurrent excitation mediated by {NMDA} receptors provides a candidate cellular mechanism for the slow time integration of sensory stimuli and the formation of categorical choices in a decision-making neocortical network.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Greylag geese are relatively small brained, but live in complex societies with social support and clan structures. They form dominance hierarchies in which families dominate pairs and unpaired individuals. However, competition is costly and the ability to transitively infer relationships among flock members may be highly advantageous. We tested five free-living, juvenile greylag geese embedded in a flock of 150 birds for their ability to track multiple dyadic relationships and their transitive inference competence. Individuals were trained on discriminations between successive pairs of five implicitly ordered colours (A–E). All individuals learned to track four dyadic relationships simultaneously and showed transitive inference when presented with nonadjacent colours. Remarkably, the amount of training required was related to the individual’s early social environment. Our study is one of the first to show transitive inference in a precocial bird and suggests an influence of early social experience on sociocognitive abilities. Furthermore, it improves our understanding of social complexity as an important selection pressure for the evolution of cognition.},

These relationships can have important fitness consequences, but most studies do not explicitly measure those relationships. An approach that explicitly measures relationships will further our understanding of social complexity and the consequences of both direct and indirect interactions. Social network analysis is the study of social groups as networks of nodes connected by social ties. This approach examines individuals and groups in the context of relationships between group members. Application of social network analysis to animal behaviour can advance the field by identifying and quantifying specific attributes of social relationships, many of which are not captured by more common measures of sociality, such as group size. Sophisticated methods for network construction and analysis exist in other fields, but until recently, have seen relatively little application to animal systems. We present a brief history of social network analysis, a description of basic concepts and previous applications to animal behaviour. We then highlight relevance and constraints of some network measures, including results from an original study of the effect of sampling on network parameter estimates, and we end with promising directions for research. By doing so, we provide a prospective overview of social network analysis' general utility for the study of animal social behaviour. © 2007 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

	abstract = {Previous empirical work on animal social learning has found that many species lack the ability to learn entire action sequences solely through reliance on social information. Conversely, acquiring action sequences through asocial learning can be difficult due to the large number of potential sequences arising from even a small number of base actions. In spite of this, several studies report that some primates use action sequences in the wild. We investigate how social information can be integrated with asocial learning to facilitate the learning of action sequences. We formalize this problem by examining how learners using temporal difference learning, a widely applicable model of reinforcement learning, can combine social cues with their own experiences to acquire action sequences. The learning problem is modeled as a Markov decision process. The learning of nettle processing by mountain gorillas serves as a focal example. Through simulations, we find that the social facilitation of component actions can combine with individual learning to facilitate the acquisition of action sequences. Our analysis illustrates that how even simple forms of social learning, combined with asocial learning, generate substantially faster learning of action sequences compared to asocial processes alone, and that the benefits of social information increase with the length of the action sequence and the number of base actions.},

The present paper deals with the first two topics, describing a constrained maximum-likelihood method of parameter estimation and developing several goodness-of-fit tests. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we deal with two specific difficulties that arise when fitting functions to psychophysical data. First, we note that human observers are prone to stimulus-independent errors (or lapses). We show that failure to account for this can lead to serious biases in estimates of the psychometric function's parameters and illustrate how the problem may be overcome. Second, we note that psychophysical data sets are usually rather small by the standards required by most of the commonly applied statistical tests. We demonstrate the potential errors of applying traditional chi2 methods to psychophysical data and advocate use of Monte Carlo resampling techniques that do not rely on asymptotic theory. We have made available the software to implement our methods.},

We employed a negative incentive contrast procedure to examine whether a decrease of sucrose concentration in a regularly visited flower type affects bumblebee (Bombus impatiens) consummatory or choice behavior. Subjects were trained to enter a test arena where they foraged on a single, red, artificial flower that contained 140 microl of sucrose solution. Subjects were reinforced with a concentration of either 0.50 or 0.20 sucrose solution in 20 trials and in 12 subsequent test trials subjects were given a choice between a red and yellow flower that each contained 140 microl of 0.20 sucrose solution. Subjects that experienced a downshift of reward showed an abrupt disruption in consumption of sucrose solution from the red flower. These subjects were also significantly more likely to visit the novel yellow flower than subjects that were reinforced with 0.20 sucrose solution in red flowers in all trials. However, the effects of the downshift of reward were transient and appeared to disrupt consummatory behavior more strongly than flower preferences. These results support the idea that bumblebee foragers form expectations of reward in flowers--as is implied by the results of studies of honeybees--and suggest that unrealized expectations of reward may cause foragers to sample alternative flowers or to fly considerable distances in search of particular types of flowers.},

When tested against a null distribution using a randomization model, the observed pattern of arrivals for the whole group of bees was random, but departures were clustered in time. Certain individuals visited the plant repeatedly and frequently throughout the day. These showed significantly regular arrival and departure schedules, which were likely produced by traplining. We explored whether these more frequent and regular foragers gained a higher reward than random or incidental plant visitors. Using an analytical model, Possingham predicted that a dominating forager that visited a simple, renewing resource in a regular pattern would garner higher and less variable rewards than random visitors. Inspired by these results, but interested in plant-level visitation, we constructed a simulation model of resource dynamics for a multiflowered plant with high visitation. The model incorporates the observed visitation schedules of all bees and independent reward dynamics for each flower on the plant. We calculated the rewards that observed bees would have collected given a range of resource-renewal parameters. More frequent visitors did not return to the plant when whole-plant resource levels were higher, but these visitors did get greater rewards. Their increased reward resulted from greater foraging efficiency, primarily through selecting (on average) more rewarding flowers than those selected by less frequent, random visitors.},

While theoretical studies have long placed a strong emphasis on context-specificity of aggression, there is increasing recognition that consistent behavioural differences exist among individuals, and that aggressiveness may be an important component of individual personality. Though empirical studies tend to focus on one aspect or the other, we suggest there is merit in modelling both within- and among-individual variation in agonistic behaviour simultaneously. Here, we demonstrate how this can be achieved using multivariate linear mixed effect models. Using data from repeated mirror trials and dyadic interactions of male green swordtails, Xiphophorus helleri, we show repeatable components of (co)variation in a suite of agonistic behaviour that is broadly consistent with a major axis of variation in aggressiveness. We also show that observed focal behaviour is dependent on opponent effects, which can themselves be repeatable but were more generally found to be context specific. In particular, our models show that within-individual variation in agonistic behaviour is explained, at least in part, by the relative size of a live opponent as predicted by contest theory. Finally, we suggest several additional applications of the multivariate models demonstrated here. These include testing the recently queried functional equivalence of alternative experimental approaches, (e.g., mirror trials, dyadic interaction tests) for assaying individual aggressiveness.},

The evolution, maintenance, and loss of self-incompatibility in plants, the nature of 'sex choice' in plants, and sex dimorphism are all explored in detail. Specific forms of biotic interactions shaping the evolution of plant reproductive strategy are discussed, and a taxonomically based review of the reproductive ecology of non-angiosperm plant groups, such as bryophytes, ferns, and algae, is presented. Together these studies focus on the complexities of plant life cycles and the distinctive reproductive biologies of these organisms, while showing the similarities between nonflowering plants and the more thoroughly documented flowering species.},

	abstract = {Aerodynamic theory predicts that minimum power (Vmp) and maximum range (Vmr) flight speeds increase when the body mass of an individual animal increases. To evaluate whether foraging bats regulate their flight speed within a fixed speed category relative to Vmp or Vmr, I investigated how the natural daily changes in body mass caused by feeding affected the flight speed of neotropical nectar-feeding bats (Phyllostomidae: Glossophaginae) within a strictly defined, stereotyped behavioural context. Individual bats were maintained in a flight tunnel (lengths of five different types 14–50 m) with a fully automated feeding, weighing (using an electronic balance at the roost) and flight speed measuring system. Flight speeds were measured during normal nocturnal foraging activity by an undisturbed bat while it flew between the two ends of the flight tunnel to obtain food from two computer-controlled nectar-feeders. For a comparison of flight enclosure measurements with field data, flight speeds were also obtained from unrestrained bats foraging in their natural environment (Costa Rica). Foraging flight speeds spanned a range of at least a factor 3 within a single species, which demonstrates the wide range of speeds possible to these animals. Significant, positive correlations between flight speed and the natural individual variability in body mass were found in nearly all cases, with body mass exponents ranging between 0.44 and 2.1. Bats flying at normal speeds were therefore not near their upper limit of muscle power. The most reliable measurements of speed increase with mass (with individual mass changes of up to 30\%) were close to the increase theoretically predicted for Vmp and Vmr for an individual bat (with constant wing span and area), which should vary as M0.42, where M is mass. This provides evidence that the glossophagine bats attemped to maintain their flight speed within a fixed speed category relative to Vmp or Vmr during foraging. Among differently sized species of glossophagine bat (N=4), flight speeds V varied with V=20M0.23, in agreement with the mass exponent of 0.21 expected from aerodynamic models for interspecific variation. In addition to the mass effect, at least five other variables significantly influenced flight speed. (1) Both mean and maximum flight speeds increased with the length and the cross-sectional area of the flight tunnel. Mean (maximum) flight speeds of 11–12 g Glossophaga soricina bats (in m s-1) were 4.6 (5.3) over a 7 m and 7. 3 (10.5) over a 50 m flight path. (2) The flight speed range adopted by a bat during one night could vary significantly between nights, independently of body mass and the effect of the size of the flight enclosure. (3) Bats flew significantly faster under illumination than in darkness. This effect was shown (i) by bats kept under natural ambient illumination that initiated foraging during the twilight phase of the evening, (ii) when bats continued to feed into the light phase directly after the dark-light transition in the laboratory and (iii) during foraging under constant, artificial illumination. (4) After a period of rest, the initial flight speed during a foraging bout was significantly increased by 25\%, but declined to the mean level within 20 s of activity. (5) Flight speed could differ significantly between foraging (flight from feeder to feeder) versus non-foraging (flight from end to end of the enclosure without visiting the feeders) flights. The results of this study demonstrate a clear ability of bats to regulate their flight speed in response to small natural changes in body mass as predicted by aerodynamic theory for Vmp and Vmr. The set point in flight speed regulation, however, was influenced by multiple additional variables.},

	abstract = {Memory systems have evolved under selection pressures, such as the need to remember the locations of resources or past events within spatiotemporally dynamic natural environments. The full repertoire of complex behaviours exhibited by animals in dynamic surroundings are, however, difficult to elicit within simply structured laboratory environments. We have developed a computer-controlled naturalistic environment with 64 feeders for simulating dynamic patterns of water or food resource availability (depletion and replenishment) within the laboratory. The combination of feeder and cage remote control permits the automated transfer of animals between cage and test arena and, therefore, high experimental throughput and minimal disturbance to the animals (bats and mice). In the present study, we investigated spatial working memory in nectar-feeding bats (Glossophaga soricina, Phyllostomidae) collecting food from a 64-feeder array. Feeders gave only single rewards within trials so that efficient foraging required bats to avoid depleted locations. Initially, bats tended to revisit feeders (win-stay), but within three trials changed towards a win-shift strategy. The significant avoidance of revisits could not be explained by algorithmic search guiding movement through the array nor by scent cues left by the bats themselves and, thus, the data suggest that bats remembered spatial locations depleted of food. An examination of the recency effect on spatial working memory after bats shifted to a win-shift strategy indicated that bats held more than 40 behaviour actions (feeder visits) in working memory without indication of decay. This result surpasses previous findings for other taxa.},

	abstract = {In recent years evidence has been accumulating that personalities are not only found in humans1 but also in a wide range of other animal species2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. Individuals differ consistently in their behavioural tendencies and the behaviour in one context is correlated with the behaviour in multiple other contexts. From an adaptive perspective, the evolution of animal personalities is still a mystery, because a more flexible structure of behaviour should provide a selective advantage9, 10, 11. Accordingly, many researchers view personalities as resulting from constraints imposed by the architecture of behaviour7 (but see ref. 12). In contrast, we show here that animal personalities can be given an adaptive explanation. Our argument is based on the insight that the trade-off between current and future reproduction13 often results in polymorphic populations14 in which some individuals put more emphasis on future fitness returns than others. Life-history theory predicts that such differences in fitness expectations should result in systematic differences in risk-taking behaviour15. Individuals with high future expectations (who have much to lose) should be more risk-averse than individuals with low expectations. This applies to all kinds of risky situations, so individuals should consistently differ in their behaviour. By means of an evolutionary model we demonstrate that this basic principle results in the evolution of animal personalities. It simultaneously explains the coexistence of behavioural types, the consistency of behaviour through time and the structure of behavioural correlations across contexts. Moreover, it explains the common finding that explorative behaviour and risk-related traits like boldness and aggressiveness are common characteristics of animal personalities2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.},

	abstract = {In many animal species, individuals differ consistently in suites of correlated behaviors, comparable with human personalities. Increasing evidence suggests that one of the fundamental factors structuring personality differences is the responsiveness of individuals to environmental stimuli. Whereas some individuals tend to be highly responsive to such stimuli, others are unresponsive and show routine-like behaviors. Much research has focused on the proximate causes of these differences but little is known about their evolutionary origin. Here, we provide an evolutionary explanation. We develop a simple but general evolutionary model that is based on two key ingredients. First, the benefits of responsiveness are frequency-dependent; that is, being responsive is advantageous when rare but disadvantageous when common. This explains why responsive and unresponsive individuals can coexist within a population. Second, positive-feedback mechanisms reduce the costs of responsiveness; that is, responsiveness is less costly for individuals that have been responsive before. This explains why individuals differ consistently in their responsiveness, across contexts and over time. As a result, natural selection gives rise to stable individual differences in responsiveness. Whereas some individuals respond to environmental stimuli in all kinds of contexts, others consistently neglect such stimuli. Interestingly, such differences induce correlations among all kinds of other traits (e.g., boldness and aggressiveness), thus providing an explanation for environment-specific behavioral syndromes.},

	abstract = {Recent research focuses on animal personalities, that is individual differences in behaviour that are consistent across contexts and over time. From an adaptive perspective, such limited behavioural plasticity is surprising, since a more flexible structure of behaviour should provide a selective advantage. Here, we argue that consistency can be advantageous because it makes individuals predictable. Predictability, however, can only be advantageous if at least some individuals in the population respond to individual differences. Consequently, the evolution of consistency and responsiveness are mutually dependent. We present a general analysis of this coevolutionary feedback for scenarios that can be represented as matrix games with two pure strategies (e.g. hawk-dove game, snowdrift game). We first show that responsive strategies are favoured whenever some individual differences are present in the population (e.g. due to mutation and drift). We then show that the presence of responsive individuals can trigger a coevolutionary process between responsiveness and consistency that gives rise to populations in which responsive individuals coexist with unresponsive individuals who show high levels of adaptive consistency in their behaviour. Next to providing an adaptive explanation for consistency, our results also link two key features associated with personalities, individual differences in responsiveness and behavioural consistency.},

	abstract = {Predation can exert strong selective pressure on the evolution of behavioral and morphological traits in birds. Because predator avoidance is key to survival and birds rely heavily on visual perception, predation may have shaped avian visual systems as well. To address this question, we examined the role of visual attention in antipredator behavior in peacocks (Pavo cristatus). Peacocks were exposed to a model predator while their gaze was continuously recorded with a telemetric eye-tracker. We found that peacocks spent more time looking at and made more fixations on the predator compared to the same spatial location before the predator was revealed. The duration of fixations they directed toward conspecifics and environmental features decreased after the predator was revealed, indicating that the peacocks were rapidly scanning their environment with their eyes. Maximum eye movement amplitudes and amplitudes of consecutive saccades were similar before and after the predator was revealed. In cases where conspecifics detected the predator first, peacocks appeared to learn that danger was present by observing conspecifics’ antipredator behavior. Peacocks were faster to detect the predator when they were fixating closer to the area where the predator would eventually appear. In addition, pupil size increased after predator exposure, consistent with increased physiological arousal. These findings demonstrate that peacocks selectively direct their attention toward predatory threats and suggest that predation has influenced the evolution of visual orienting systems.},

Traditionally, this function is estimated by fitting a parametric model to the experimental data, usually the proportion of successful trials at each stimulus level. Common models include the Gaussian and Weibull cumulative distribution functions. This approach works well if the model is correct, but it can mislead if not. In practice, the correct model is rarely known. Here, a nonparametric approach based on local linear fitting is advocated. No assumption is made about the true model underlying the data, except that the function is smooth. The critical role of the bandwidth is identified, and its optimum value estimated by a cross-validation procedure. As a demonstration, seven vision and hearing data sets were fitted by the local linear method and by several parametric models. The local linear method frequently performed better and never worse than the parametric ones.

An implicit assumption underlying the majority of choice tests is that the preferences obtained are independent of the set of options available in the test. This follows from two assumptions about the mechanisms of choice: first, that animals use absolute evaluation mechanisms to assign value to options, and second, that the probability of choosing an option is proportional to the ratio between the value of that option and the sum of the values of the other options available. However, if either of these assumptions is incorrect then preferences can differ depending on the composition of the choice set. In support of this concern, evidence from foraging animals shows that preferences can change when a third, less preferred option is added to a binary choice. These findings have implications for the design and interpretation of choice tests.},

The {ADE} is a violation of regularity and the constant-ratio rule, which are two derivations of the independence of irrelevant alternatives axiom, a core tenant of rational choice. The {ADE} is one of the most widely reported human choice phenomena, leading researchers to probe its origins by studying a variety of non-human species. We examined the {ADE} in brown capuchin monkeys (Cebus apella), a species that displays many other decision biases. In Experiment 1, we used a touchscreen method to elicit choice-based preferences for food rewards in asymmetrically dominated choice sets. In Experiments 2 and 3, we distinguished between different types of judgments and used a free selection task to elicit consumption-based preferences for juice rewards. However, we found no evidence for the {ADE} through violations of regularity or the constant-ratio rule, despite the similarity of our stimuli to other human and non-human experiments. While these results appear to conflict with existing literature on the {ADE} in non-human species, we point out methodological differences—notably, the distinction between value-based and perception-based stimuli—that have led to a collection of phenomena that are difficult to understand under a unitary theoretical framework. In particular, we highlight key differences between the human and non-human research and provide a series of steps that researchers could take to better understand the {ADE}.},

As human choices can be altered depending on whether they encounter options simultaneously or sequentially, it seems plausible that animal choices may also be influenced by the way in which they encounter options. Here, we examined whether birds’ choices were affected by the way in which they learned about possible options. In one treatment, we presented hummingbirds with each of three foraging options (5, 20 or 30 \% sucrose solution) either sequentially or simultaneously before presenting birds with a choice of all three options simultaneously. When the birds had learned about options simultaneously, they had stronger preferences for the best option (30 \%) than when they had learned about the options sequentially. These data are consistent with the stronger preferences for simultaneously encountered options in the mate choice literature. In both situations, it is possible that this effect comes about because it is easier to discriminate among multiple options presented simultaneously and/or because there are costs of failing to accept an option when those options are presented/encountered sequentially.},

In nearly all such cases, the unattractive dominated option enhances the attractiveness of the option it most resembles—a phenomenon known as the “attraction effect.” In the studies presented here, however, the authors contend that this phenomenon may be restricted to stylized product representations in which every product dimension is represented by a number (e.g., a toaster oven that has a durability rating of 7.2 and ease of cleaning rating of 5.5). Such effects do not typically occur when consumers experience the product (e.g., taste a drink) or when even one of the product attributes is represented perceptually (e.g., differently priced hotel rooms whose quality is depicted with a photo). The authors posit that perceptual representations of attributes do not support the sorts of comparisons that drive the attraction effect with highly stylized examples, and they question the practical significance of the effect.},

	abstract = {Experimentally naive mice matched the proportions of their temporal investments (visit durations) in two feeding hoppers to the proportions of the food income (pellets per unit session time) derived from them in three experiments that varied the coupling between the behavioral investment and food income, from no coupling to strict coupling. Matching was observed from the outset; it did not improve with training. When the numbers of pellets received were proportional to time invested, investment was unstable, swinging abruptly from sustained, almost complete investment in one hopper, to sustained, almost complete investment in the other—in the absence of appropriate local fluctuations in returns (pellets obtained per time invested). The abruptness of the swings strongly constrains possible models. We suggest that matching reflects an innate (unconditioned) program that matches the ratio of expected visit durations to the ratio between the current estimates of expected incomes. A model that processes the income stream looking for changes in the income and generates discontinuous income estimates when a change is detected is shown to account for salient features of the data.},

	abstract = {Context-dependent choice is an important aspect of decision making. The paper examines context-dependent choice in cats (Felis catus), with particular reference to the effect of local context, on the basis of hypotheses developed in the field of human decision making. Cats were initially confronted with two different feeding options. This binary choice set was later manipulated incorporating a decoy that was better than the available options but ultimately unavailable (a phantom). By means of a within-subjects manipulation of phantom location in the attribute space, the author compared the effects of close and distant phantoms on the final choices. The main finding is that close phantom decoys affected choice behavior of cats by altering the overall share of the available options, leading some animals to reject even some of the available feeding options, and by causing the animals to favor the available option that was more similar to the phantom decoy. No significant effects emerged for phantoms that were far from the alternatives in the attribute space. The strengths of this paper lie in its novel approach and high originality. No other study has used dominating decoys with animals or decoys that are unattainable. This paper provides strong links to the human decision making literature, the presentation of the predictions of a range of different choice models, and the novelty of the application to animals. The use of a phantom decoy is particularly interesting because the phantom cannot actually be chosen, and thus the binary and trinary choice sets both have the very same choices available. Overall, the effect of phantoms is real, interesting and new.},

All sampled species were grouped into three broad categories (trochilophilous, chiropterophilous, or lepidopterophilous) according to their main pollination mode. Significant differences between the different pollination syndromes were found in nectar sugar composition as well as concentration. For a total of four genera (Guzmania, Pitcairnia, Tillandsia and Vriesea), a comparison of nectar composition showed significant differences between trochilophilous and chiropterophilous species. Data presented here indicate that the characteristics of nectar in Bromeliaceae are predominantly determined by putative adaptations of nectar sugars to preferences of the pollinators rather than by phylogenetic relations.},

	abstract = {Most pollinators prefer the sugars present in the nectar they consume, so it has been hypothesized that they have molded nectar trait evolution. However, nectar-feeding bats do not exhibit preferences for the sugars present in their diet. We analyzed the role that biochemical and ecological factors could play in shaping the nectar traits of chiropterophilic plants. We studied nectar traits and flower production in 49 plant species. We evaluated the relationship between nectar concentration and sugar composition using phylogenetically independent contrasts and if nectar traits were related to flower production using a Manova. We found that 42 species produced high hexoses nectars, and 7 species produced sucrose rich nectars. Phylogenetically independent contrasts showed that nectar concentration was negatively related to glucose content, positively related to fructose content, and was not related to sucrose content. A negative relationship was found from glucose and fructose contents to sucrose content, and glucose content was negatively related to fructose content. Finally, we did not found any relationship between nectar traits and the plants’ flowering strategies. We conclude that bat physiology and the relative low evolutionary time of the interaction between plants and bats may determine the lack of pattern in the nectar characteristics of chiropterophilic plants.
La mayoría de los polinizadores prefieren los azúcares presentes en el néctar que consumen, por lo que se ha especulado que estos han moldeado la evolución de los rasgos del néctar. Sin embargo, los murciélagos nectarívoros no muestran preferencias por los azúcares presentes en su dieta. Analizamos el papel que los factores bioquímicos y ecológicos pueden desempeñar en los rasgos de néctar de 32 plantas quirotperofílicas. Se estudiaron las características del néctar y la producción de flores en 49 especies de plantas. Se evaluó la relación entre la concentración del néctar y la composición de azúcares usando contrastes filogenéticamente independientes y si los rasgos del néctar están relacionados con la producción de flores utilizando una Manova. Se encontró que 42 especies producen néctares con altos contenidos de hexosas y 7 especies producen néctares ricos en sacarosa. Los contrastes filogenéticamente independientes mostraron que la concentración de néctar se relaciona negativamente con el contenido de glucosa, positivamente con el de fructosa y no tuvo relación con el contenido de sacarosa. Se encontró una relación negativa del contenido de glucosa y fructosa con el de sacarosa y el contenido de glucosa se relacionó negativamente con el de fructosa. Por último, no encontramos ninguna relación entre los rasgos de néctar y las estrategias de floración. Concluimos que la fisiología de los murciélagos y el poco tiempo evolutivo de la interacción entre las plantas y los murciélagos pueden determinar la falta de patrón en los rasgos del néctar quiropterofílico.},

Extensive neurological and behavioral results increasingly suggest that animal beliefs may be represented as probability distributions, with explicit accounting of uncertainty. Accordingly, we develop a model that describes decision-making in a manner consistent with this understanding of neuronal function in learning and conditioning. This first-order Markov, recursive Bayesian algorithm is as parsimonious as its minimalist point-estimate, Rescorla–Wagner analogue. We show that the Bayesian algorithm can reproduce naturalistic patterns of probabilistic foraging, in simulations of an experiment in bumblebees. We go on to show that the Bayesian algorithm can efficiently describe the behavior of several heuristic models of decision-making, and is consistent with the ubiquitous variation in choice that we observe within and between individuals in implementing heuristic decision-making. By describing learning and decision-making in a single Bayesian framework, we believe we can realistically unify descriptions of behavior across contexts and organisms. A unified cognitive model of this kind may facilitate descriptions of behavioral evolution.},

An experiment using the time-left procedure (Gibbon \& Church, 1981) is reported with motivational differentials induced by unequal reinforcement durations. The preference results were compatible with a ratio-comparator decision rule, but not with decision rules based on differences. Differential reinforcement amounts were functionally equivalent to changes in delays to food. Under biased reinforcement, overall food rate was increased, but variance in preference was increased or decreased depending on which alternative was favored. This is a Weber law finding that is compatible with multiplicative, scalar sources of variance but incompatible with pacemaker rate changes proportional to food presentation rate.},

In the honey bee, the gustatory sense has remained largely unexplored, as tastants have been traditionally used as reinforcements rather than as stimuli to be learned and discriminated. Here we provide the first characterization of antennal gustatory perception in this insect using a novel conditioning protocol in which tastants are dissociated from their traditional food-reinforcement role to be learned as predictors of punishment. We found that bees have a limited gustatory repertoire via their antennae: they discriminate between broad gustatory modalities but not within modalities, and are unable to differentiate bitter substances from water. Coupling gustatory conditioning with blockade of aminergic pathways in the bee brain revealed that these pathways are not restricted to encode reinforcements but may also encode conditioned stimuli. Our results reveal unknown aspects of honey bee gustation, and bring new elements for comparative analyses of gustatory perception in animals.},

Theory posits that selection favours the integration of ‘intrinsic state’ and behaviour. Metabolism, hormones, energetic reserves and structural size have particularly been proposed as states covarying with behaviour among-individuals, either genetically or through plasticity integration. We conducted a meta-analysis estimating the amount of among-individual variation in behaviour attributable to variation in state. Our literature search showed that only 22\% of the studies claiming to estimate individual-level associations between state and behaviour actually did so. Our meta-analysis revealed that relatively aggressive, bold, explorative and/or active individuals had relatively high metabolic rates, hormone levels, body weights and/or body sizes. The proportion of among-individual variation common to state and behaviour was nevertheless small (approx. 5\%). This means that (i) adaptive explanations involving intrinsic states fail to explain much individual variation in behaviour, (ii) empiricists should consider nonlinear, additive or interactive effects of (multiple) intrinsic states, (iii) explanations not involving intrinsic states might be important, or (iv) empirical tests of state-dependent personality theory were inappropriate. Our meta-analysis highlights the importance of feedback between empiricists and theoreticians in the study of adaptive behavioural variation.},

Personality has been linked to life-history traits, energetic traits and fitness, with implications for the evolution of behaviour. Personality has been quantified for a range of taxa (e.g., fish, songbirds, small mammals) but, so far, there has been little work on personality in bats, despite their diversity and potential as a model taxon for comparative studies. We used a novel environment test to quantify personality in little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus) and assess the short-term repeatability of a range of behaviours. We tested the hypothesis that development influences values of personality traits and predicted that trait values associated with activity would increase between newly volant, pre-weaning young-of-the-year ({YOY}) and more mature, self-sufficient {YOY}. We identified personality dimensions that were consistent with past studies of other taxa and found that these traits were repeatable over a 24-hour period. Consistent with our prediction, older {YOY} captured at a fall swarming site prior to hibernation had higher activity scores than younger {YOY} bats captured at a maternity colony, suggesting that personality traits vary as development progresses in {YOY} bats. Thus, we found evidence of short-term consistency of personality within individuals but with the potential for temporal flexibility of traits, depending on age.},

We tested whether psychophysical laws explain how female túngara frogs (Physalaemus pustulosus) and frog-eating bats (Trachops cirrhosus) compare male frog calls, and how this imposes selection on call evolution. Although both frogs and bats prefer more elaborate calls, they are less selective as call elaboration increases, because preference is based on stimulus ratios. Thus, as call elaboration increases, both relative attractiveness and relative predation risk decrease because of how receivers perceive and compare stimuli. Our data show that female cognition can limit the evolution of sexual signal elaboration.
Receiver perception limits the evolution of increasingly elaborate calls in túngara frogs.

	abstract = {A third option leads to poor mates
A “decoy” effect decreases rational decision-making in humans. Irrational decisions in this case are a result of a choice between two options being affected by the introduction of a suboptimal third choice. Lea and Ryan show that tungara frogs are also subject to a decoy effect, choosing a male with a less appealing call when presented with a third, inferior calling male. These results suggest that the choice of mates by animals may be context dependent. It appears that rational choice may not always drive sexual selection.
Science, this issue p. 964
Mate choice models derive from traditional microeconomic decision theory and assume that individuals maximize their Darwinian fitness by making economically rational decisions. Rational choices exhibit regularity, whereby the relative strength of preferences between options remains stable when additional options are presented. We tested female frogs with three simulated males who differed in relative call attractiveness and call rate. In binary choice tests, females’ preferences favored stimulus caller B over caller A; however, with the addition of an inferior “decoy” C, females reversed their preferences and chose A over B. These results show that the relative valuation of mates is not independent of inferior alternatives in the choice set and therefore cannot be explained with the rational choice models currently used in sexual selection theory.
Female túngara frogs can be tricked into choosing less attractive mates.

	abstract = {Most models of animal behavior assume rationality in animal’s decisions, with animals maintaining strict preferences for different options (e.g., optimal foraging theory). In the wild, however, animals often choose among several options simultaneously, and their evaluation of each prey type may depend on the perceived relative values of other choices. Fringe-lipped bats (Trachops cirrhosus) are promising subjects for studying how animals make decisions. When given a choice between the calls of two species of frogs, T. cirrhosus will choose the more salient call that is associated with the higher capture rate. Although in the wild T. cirrhosus often choose among multiple call options, most tests of prey preferences in this system include only two options. In this experiment, we tested whether T. cirrhosus alters relative preference for two call types that differ along two acoustic dimensions (amplitude and complexity) when presented with a third, “decoy” option, inferior to the two original options along either one or both dimensions. Results from this study demonstrate that under these circumstances, T. cirrhosus evaluates all three options independently of one another, and thus, preferences remain consistent and rational in both the presence and absence of a decoy. These results counter many other experiments suggesting irrationality in animal decision-making.Significance {statementA} fundamental assumption of animal behavior is that animals make rational decisions. However, most animals are tested in ways that rely on simple binary choice experiments. Because animals are often faced with multiple options simultaneously in the wild, these tests may often fail to capture the complexity necessary to understand cognitive limitations that naturally influence animal decisions. In certain cases, complex decisions can result in irrational behavior that is inconsistent with what is found in binary choice studies. Here, we conducted a test with fringe-lipped bats to determine whether their choices for specific frog calls were influenced by the number of options in a choice set. We found that, unlike many other animals, the fringe-lipped bats appear to make consistent decisions, even with more complex choice sets. Our results indicate that there are likely to be strong selective pressures on rational decision-making in this species, perhaps shaped by high metabolic requirements.},

Individuals that forage more efficiently (i.e., when energy gained exceeds energy expended) are likely to be more successful at raising viable offspring than individuals that forage less efficiently. Our goal was to test this prediction in large long-lived mammals under free-ranging conditions. To do so, we equipped 20 lactating Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella) breeding on Kerguelen Island in the Southern Ocean with tags that recorded {GPS} locations, depth and tri-axial acceleration to determine at-sea behaviours and detailed time-activity budgets during their foraging trips. We also simultaneously measured energy spent at sea using the doubly-labeled water ({DLW}) method, and estimated the energy acquired while foraging from 1) type and energy content of prey species present in scat remains, and 2) numbers of prey capture attempts determined from head acceleration. Finally, we followed the growth of 36 pups from birth until weaning (of which 20 were the offspring of our 20 tracked mothers), and used the relative differences in body mass of pups at weaning as an index of first year survival and thus the reproductive success of their mothers. Our results show that females with greater foraging efficiencies produced relatively bigger pups at weaning. These mothers achieved greater foraging efficiency by extracting more energy per minute of diving rather than by reducing energy expenditure. This strategy also resulted in the females spending less time diving and less time overall at sea, which allowed them to deliver higher quality milk to their pups, or allowed their pups to suckle more frequently, or both. The linkage we demonstrate between reproductive success and the quality of individuals as foragers provides an individual-based quantitative framework to investigate how changes in the availability and accessibility of prey can affect fitness of animals.},

So, if behavioral ecology already takes an evolutionary approach to variation in behavior, we ask what is personality research about exactly? This question is particularly pertinent now the focus of personality research shifts and the field moves away from being mainly descriptive to include quantitative frameworks. As a result, the field has come to borrow heavily from already established fields.

Animal ‘personality’, defined as repeatable inter-individual differences in behaviour, is a concept in biology that faces intense controversy. Critics argue that the field is riddled with terminological and methodological inconsistencies and lacks a sound theoretical framework. Nevertheless, experimental biologists are increasingly studying individual differences in physiology and relating these to differences in behaviour, which can lead to fascinating insights. We encourage this trend, and in this Commentary we highlight some of the benefits of estimating variation in (and covariation among) phenotypic traits at the inter- and intra-individual levels. We focus on behaviour while drawing parallels with physiological and performance-related traits. First, we outline some of the confusion surrounding the terminology used to describe repeatable inter-individual differences in behaviour. Second, we argue that acknowledging individual behavioural differences can help researchers avoid sampling and experimental bias, increase explanatory power and, ultimately, understand how selection acts on physiological traits. Third, we summarize the latest methods to collect, analyse and present data on individual trait variation. We note that, while measuring the repeatability of phenotypic traits is informative in its own right, it is only the first step towards understanding how natural selection and genetic architecture shape intra-specific variation in complex, labile traits. Thus, understanding how and why behavioural traits evolve requires linking repeatable inter-individual behavioural differences with core aspects of physiology (e.g. neurophysiology, endocrinology, energy metabolism) and evolutionary biology (e.g. selection gradients, heritability).},

Personality differences can arise, for example, from differences in permanent environmental effects―including parental and epigenetic contributors―and the effect of additive genetic variation. Although several studies have evaluated the heritability of behaviour, less is known about general patterns of heritability and additive genetic variation in animal personality. As overall variation in behaviour includes both the among-individual differences that reflect different personalities and temporary environmental effects, it is possible for personality to be largely genetically influenced even when heritability of behaviour per se is quite low. The relative contribution of additive genetic variation to personality variation can be estimated whenever both repeatability and heritability are estimated for the same data. Using published estimates to address this issue, we found that approximately 52\% of animal personality variation was attributable to additive genetic variation. Thus, while the heritability of behaviour is often moderate or low, the heritability of personality is much higher. Our results therefore (i) demonstrate that genetic differences are likely to be a major contributor to variation in animal personality and (ii) support the phenotypic gambit: that evolutionary inferences drawn from repeatability estimates may often be justified.},

Measures of exploratory behaviour of individuals at repeated captures were consistent in both sexes and study areas (repeatabilities ranged from 0.27 to 0.48). Exploration scores did not differ between the sexes, and were unrelated to age, condition at fledging or condition during measurement. Heritability estimates were 0.22–0.41 (parent–offspring regressions) and 0.37–0.40 (sibling analyses). We conclude that (1) consistent individual variation in open field behaviour exists in individuals from the wild, and (2) this behavioural variation is heritable. This is one of the first studies showing heritable variation in a behavioural trait in animals from the wild, and poses the question of how this variation is maintained under natural conditions.

Study eligibility criteria were: personality model, behavior genetic study design, self-reported data, essential statistical indicators, and independent samples. A total of 134 primary studies with 190 potentially independent effect sizes were identified. After exclusion of studies that did not meet inclusion criteria and/or met 1 of the exclusion criteria, the final sample included 62 independent effect sizes, representing more than 100,000 participants of both genders and all ages. Data analyses were performed using the random-effects model, software program R package metafor. The average effect size was .40, indicating that 40\% of individual differences in personality were due to genetic, while 60\% are due to environmental influences. After correction for possible publication bias the conclusion was unaltered. Additional analyses showed that personality model and gender were not significant moderators of personality heritability estimate, while study design was a significant moderator with twin studies showing higher estimates, .47, compared to family and adoption studies, .22. Personality model also was not a significant moderator of heritability estimates for neuroticism or extraversion, 2 personality traits contained in most personality trait theories and/or models. This study is the first to empirically test and confirm moderator effect of study design on heritability estimates in the field of personality. Limitations of the study, as well as suggestion for future studies, are discussed. ({PsycINFO} Database Record},

Animal personality has been proposed to emerge as an adaptation to individual differences in state variables, leading to the question of why individuals differ consistently in state. Recent theory emphasizes the role that positive feedbacks between state and behaviour can play in producing consistent among-individual covariance between state and behaviour, hence state-dependent personality. We review the role of feedbacks in recent models of adaptive personalities, and provide guidelines for empirical testing of model assumptions and predictions. We discuss the importance of the mediating effects of ecology on these feedbacks, and provide a roadmap for including state–behaviour feedbacks in behavioural ecology research.},

To illustrate, we discuss in detail an experimental protocol in which animals systematically incur substantial foraging losses by preferring a lean but informative option over a rich but non-informative one. To understand how adaptive mechanisms may fail to maximize food intake, we review a model inspired by optimal foraging principles that reconciles sub-optimal choice with the view that current behavioral mechanisms were pruned by the optimizing action of natural selection. To move beyond retrospective speculation, we then review critical tests of the model, regarding both its assumptions and its (sometimes counterintuitive) predictions, all of which have been upheld. The overall contention is that (a) known mechanisms can be used to develop better ultimate accounts and that (b) to understand why mechanisms that generate suboptimal behavior evolved, we need to consider their adaptive value in the animal’s characteristic ecology.},

Rewards differed in one of two dimensions, volume or probability. Our results suggest that mouse choice conforms to the principles of economic rationality for options that differ along a single reward dimension. A psychometric analysis of mouse choices further revealed that mice responded more strongly to differences in probability than to differences in volume, despite equivalence in return rates. This study also demonstrates the synergistic effect between the principles of economic rationality and psychophysics in making quantitative predictions about choices of healthy laboratory mice. This opens up new possibilities for the analyses of multi-dimensional choice and the use of mice with cognitive impairments that may violate economic rationality.},

	abstract = {A major challenge in understanding choice behaviour is determining how subjects evaluate alternatives that differ along multiple dimensions. Of particular interest is whether similar dimensions are compared to each other or whether each alternative is assigned an absolute value (utility). We assumed that choice proportions would follow Weber's effect, according to which discrimination is proportional to relative difference (difference/mean). We tested honey bees in a two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) paradigm of proboscis-extension response ({PER}) conditioning. Subjects were conditioned over six trials to associate each of two odours with sucrose solution rewards and then tested in a choice trial between the two alternatives. Each group of subjects was tested in one treatment, and there were four treatments in each of six experiments. Rewards differed in delay, duration of feeding, and sucrose concentration. In each treatment, the high-profitability alternative was better than the low-profitability alternative along a single dimension, but between treatments of each experiment values in another dimension monotonically increased. Proboscis-response proportions during the conditioning phase tended to be greater for the high-profitability alternative, and choice proportions for it in the choice phase ranged between 0.72 and 0.89 in the 24 treatments. We show for the first time that harnessed bees are sensitive to reward delay. Preferences did not differ statistically between the different treatments of any of the experiments. The results support comparative evaluation of alternatives and are pertinent to multi-attribute choice, with implications for context-dependent preferences. We also discuss the potential advantages of the 2AFC {PER} simultaneous choice assay.},

Little is known, however, about the decision rules animals use. We compare patterns of information sampling by western scrub‐jays (Aphelocoma californica) when choosing a nut with three decision rules: best of n ({BN}), flexible threshold ({FT}), and comparative Bayes ({CB}). First, we use a null hypothesis testing approach and find that the {CB} decision rule, in which individuals use past experiences to make nonrandom assessment and choice decisions, produces patterns of behavior that more closely correspond to observed patterns of nut sampling in scrub‐jays than the other two rules. This approach does not allow us to quantify how much better {CB} is at predicting scrub‐jay behavior than the other decision rules. Second, we use a model selection approach that uses Akaike Information Criteria to quantify how well alternative models approximate observed data. We find that the {CB} rule is much more likely to produce the observed patterns of scrub‐jay behavior than the other rules. This result provides some of the best empirical evidence of the use of Bayesian information updating by a nonhuman animal.},

Using a novel split-colony experimental design we evaluated visual learning performance of foraging naïve bumble bees (Bombus terrestris) in an ecologically relevant associative learning task under controlled laboratory conditions, before monitoring the lifetime foraging performance of the same individual bees in the field. We found appreciable variation among the 85 workers tested in both their learning and foraging performance, which was not predicted by colony membership. However, rather than finding that foragers benefited from enhanced learning performance, we found that fast and slow learners collected food at comparable rates and completed a similar number of foraging bouts per day in the field. Furthermore, bees with better learning abilities foraged for fewer days; suggesting a cost of enhanced learning performance in the wild. As a result, slower learning individuals collected more resources for their colony over the course of their foraging career. These results demonstrate that enhanced cognitive traits are not necessarily beneficial to the foraging performance of individuals or colonies in all environments.},

Here, we show evidence of sheltering behaviour personality in a gregarious insect (Periplaneta americana), which is characterized by a collective personality at the group level. We also highlight that the individuals within groups exhibited consistent personality traits in their probability of sheltering and total time sheltered during the three trials over one week. Moreover, the group personality, which arises from the synergy between the distribution of behaviour profiles in the group and social amplifications, affected the sheltering dynamics. However, owing to its robustness, personality did not affect the group probability of reaching a consensus. Finally, to prove social interactions, we developed a new statistical method that will be helpful for future research on personality traits and group behaviour.

Kahneman, 1991) arise from attention switching between attributes and similarity-dependent inhibitory interactions among alternatives. However, there are several reasons to maintain loss aversion in a theory of choice. In view of this, an alternative theory is proposed, integrating loss aversion and attention switching into a nonlinear model (M. Usher \& J.

	abstract = {Humans and animals are exquisitely, though idiosyncratically, sensitive to risk or variance in the outcomes of their actions. Economic, psychological, and neural aspects of this are well studied when information about risk is provided explicitly. However, we must normally learn about outcomes from experience, through trial and error. Traditional models of such reinforcement learning focus on learning about the mean reward value of cues and ignore higher order moments such as variance. We used {fMRI} to test whether the neural correlates of human reinforcement learning are sensitive to experienced risk. Our analysis focused on anatomically delineated regions of a priori interest in the nucleus accumbens, where blood oxygenation level-dependent ({BOLD}) signals have been suggested as correlating with quantities derived from reinforcement learning. We first provide unbiased evidence that the raw {BOLD} signal in these regions corresponds closely to a reward prediction error. We then derive from this signal the learned values of cues that predict rewards of equal mean but different variance and show that these values are indeed modulated by experienced risk. Moreover, a close neurometric–psychometric coupling exists between the fluctuations of the experience-based evaluations of risky options that we measured neurally and the fluctuations in behavioral risk aversion. This suggests that risk sensitivity is integral to human learning, illuminating economic models of choice, neuroscientific models of affective learning, and the workings of the underlying neural mechanisms.},

	abstract = {Pollination syndromes (correlations between floral and pollinator traits), have long interested ecologists, but remain inadequately explained. For example, plant species pollinated by relatively large animals cannot have evolved correspondingly high rates of nectar-energy production simply because such animals need relatively more energy; evolution does not work that way. The inverse correlation between pollinator body-size and nectar concentration is similarly difficult to explain. To remedy this, I propose that Optimal Foraging Theory ({OFT}) and the Evolutionarily Stable Strategy approach ({ESS}) be combined and applied to pollination syndromes. Both hypothesise that, through evolution, average biological fitness of individuals has been maximised. {OFT} predicts foraging consequences for pollinators varying in body size, and other attributes, allowing the {ESS} approach to be applied to co-adapted plant–pollinator traits. This should lead to predicted relationships between plants and their pollinators. The steps involved in this process are conceptually straightforward, but empirically difficult, which may explain why the approach has been very little pursued in the past. However such difficulties can be overcome, thus pointing to the future. We surely need to understand pollination systems, in order to conserve and manage them. It is therefore time to reconnect {OFT} and plant–pollinator co-evolution, within the general {ESS} approach, and hence increasing our understanding of pollination syndromes and other plant–pollinator relationships.},

	abstract = {In classical optimal foraging models long-term rate of energy intake (the ratio of expected amount of food over expected time) is assumed to be the maximized currency, because doing this is consistent with minimizing the loss of alternative opportunities. Here this possibility and various alternatives are examined quantitatively using European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) in the laboratory The birds chose between two cues. One signaled an option that led to either a fixed delay to food (“single standard,” Experiment 1) or to one of two equally probable delays to food (“double standard,” Experiments 2 and 3). The other cue signaled an “adjusting option” consisting of a single delay to food. This option adjusted according to the previous choices made by the birds, improving when the standard had been preferred and worsening when the adjusting option had been preferred. Adjustments were made either by changing the delay to food or the amount of food. The rationale underlying this procedure was that the parameter values at which the adjusting option stabilizes should reflect the subjective value of the standard. This was validated in Experiment 1. In Experiments 2 and 3 the adjusting option fluctuated around parameter values that are interpreted as yielding subjective equivalents of the double standard. The results contradict the predictions based on minimizing the lost opportunity. First, the birds did not include all the time intervals in their assignment of value to the two options, and second, the birds used the expected ratio of amount over time rather than the ratio of expected amount over expected time as their rate currency.[Behav Ecol 7: 341–352 (1996)]},

In a “single bisection”, the standards' duration was constant across trials. In a “roving bisection”, the two standards were trial unique. We compared our results with the predictions from a model related to Scalar Expectancy Theory, with the added assumption that the decision process minimizes the expected number of errors given the information available. The model shows that if errors in reference memory were dominant the psychometric function should be identical for single and roving tasks, and if perceptual errors were dominant the psychometric function should be steeper for the single than for the roving bisection. As we found that psychometric functions were steeper for the single than for the roving tasks, we concluded that perceptual errors are dominant.},

	abstract = {Most reinforcement learning algorithms optimize the expected return of a Markov Decision Problem. Practice has taught us the lesson that this criterion is not always the most suitable because many applications require robust control strategies which also take into account the variance of the return. Classical control literature provides several techniques to deal with risk-sensitive optimization goals like the so-called worst-case optimality criterion exclusively focusing on risk-avoiding policies or classical risk-sensitive control, which transforms the returns by exponential utility functions. While the first approach is typically too restrictive, the latter suffers from the absence of an obvious way to design a corresponding model-free reinforcement learning algorithm.Our risk-sensitive reinforcement learning algorithm is based on a very different philosophy. Instead of transforming the return of the process, we transform the temporal differences during learning. While our approach reflects important properties of the classical exponential utility framework, we avoid its serious drawbacks for learning. Based on an extended set of optimality equations we are able to formulate risk-sensitive versions of various well-known reinforcement learning algorithms which converge with probability one under the usual conditions.},

By applying a utility function to the temporal difference ({TD}) error, nonlinear transformations are effectively applied not only to the received rewards but also to the true transition probabilities of the underlying Markov decision process. When appropriate utility functions are chosen, the agents' behaviors express key features of human behavior as predicted by prospect theory (Kahneman and Tversky, 1979), for example different risk-preferences for gains and losses as well as the shape of subjective probability curves. We derive a risk-sensitive Q-learning algorithm, which is necessary for modeling human behavior when transition probabilities are unknown, and prove its convergence. As a proof of principle for the applicability of the new framework we apply it to quantify human behavior in a sequential investment task. We find, that the risk-sensitive variant provides a significantly better fit to the behavioral data and that it leads to an interpretation of the subject's responses which is indeed consistent with prospect theory. The analysis of simultaneously measured {fMRI} signals show a significant correlation of the risk-sensitive {TD} error with {BOLD} signal change in the ventral striatum. In addition we find a significant correlation of the risk-sensitive Q-values with neural activity in the striatum, cingulate cortex and insula, which is not present if standard Q-values are used.},

This advantage of the anti-correlated alternative is well accounted for in the {LCA}, and provides constraints that challenge several other models of multi-alternative choice.},

	abstract = {Despite the widespread assumption that the learning abilities of animals are adapted to the particular environments in which they operate, the quantitative effects of learning performance on fitness remain virtually unknown. Here, we evaluate the learning performance of bumble-bees (Bombus terrestris) from multiple colonies in an ecologically relevant associative learning task under laboratory conditions, before testing the foraging performance of the same colonies under the field conditions. We demonstrate that variation in learning speed among bumble-bee colonies is directly correlated with the foraging performance, a robust fitness measure, under natural conditions. Colonies vary in learning speed by a factor of nearly five, with the slowest learning colonies collecting 40\% less nectar than the fastest learning colonies. Such a steep fitness function is suggestive of strong selection for higher learning speed. Partial correlation analysis reveals that other factors such as forager body size or colour preference appear to be negligible in our study. Although our study does not directly prove causality of learning on foraging success, our approach of correlating natural within-species variation in these two factors represents a major advance over traditional between-species correlative analyses where comparability can be compromised by the fact that species vary along multiple dimensions.},

In a world in which the cognitive abilities of bees regularly make the news, research on the influence of ecology and sensory systems on bee behaviour is leading to novel insights in hummingbird cognition.

Thus, visual illusions have been central to the science and philosophy of human consciousness for decades. Here we explain the root cause of brightness illusions, not by modelling human perception or its assumed physiological substrate (as is more typically done), but by modelling the basic challenge that all visual animals must resolve if they are to survive: the inherent ambiguity of sensory data. We do this by training synthetic neural networks to recognise surfaces under different lights in scenes with naturalistic structure. The result is that the networks not only solve this task robustly (i.e., they exhibit “lightness constancy”), they also—as a consequence—exhibit the same illusions of lightness that humans also see. In short, these synthetic systems not only get it right like we do, but also get it wrong like we do, too. This emergent coincidence strongly provides causal evidence that illusions (and by extension all percepts) represent the probable source of images in past visual experience, which has fundamental consequences for explaining how and why we see what we do. The study also suggests the first formal definition of what an illusion is: The condition in which the actual source of a stimulus differs from its most likely source.},

Animal models can be exploited to learn about the biological underpinnings of shared human traits, and although no other animals display speech or language, a range of behaviors found throughout the animal kingdom are relevant to speech and spoken language. To date, such investigations have been dominated by studies of our closest primate relatives searching for shared traits, or more distantly related species that are sophisticated vocal communicators, like songbirds. Herein I make the case for turning our attention to the Chiropterans, to shed new light on the biological encoding and evolution of human language-relevant traits. Bats employ complex vocalizations to facilitate navigation as well as social interactions, and are exquisitely tuned to acoustic information. Furthermore, bats display behaviors such as vocal learning and vocal turn-taking that are directly pertinent for human spoken language. Emerging technologies are now allowing the study of bat vocal communication, from the behavioral to the neurobiological and molecular level. Although it is clear that no single animal model can reflect the complexity of human language, by comparing such findings across diverse species we can identify the shared biological mechanisms likely to have influenced the evolution of human language.},

If there is quantum structure in cognition, then there has to be evidence for the collapse postulate. A striking, a priori prediction, is that opinion change will be slowed down (under idealized conditions frozen) by continuous judgements. In physics, this is the quantum Zeno effect. We demonstrate a quantum Zeno effect in decision-making in humans and so provide evidence that advocates the use of quantum principles in decision theory, at least in some cases.},

One theory spanning several fields of neuroscience proposes that their values are distilled to a single common neural currency, the calculation of which allows for rational decisions. The orbitofrontal cortex ({OFC}) is thought to play a critical role in this process, based on the presence of neural correlates of economic value in lateral {OFC} in monkeys and medial {OFC} in humans. We previously inactivated lateral {OFC} in rats without affecting economic choice behavior. Here we inactivated medial {OFC} in the same task, again without effect. Behavior in the same rats was disrupted by inactivation during progressive ratio responding previously shown to depend on medial {OFC}, demonstrating the efficacy of the inactivation. These results indicate that medial {OFC} is not necessary for economic choice, bolstering the proposal that classic economic choice is likely mediated by multiple, overlapping neural circuits.},

Economists have long argued on theoretical grounds that humans typically make these choices as if the values of the options they consider have been mapped to a single common scale for comparison. Neuroimaging studies in humans have recently begun to suggest the existence of a small group of specific brain sites that appear to encode the subjective values of different types of rewards on a neural common scale, almost exactly as predicted by theory. We have conducted a meta analysis using data from thirteen different functional magnetic resonance imaging studies published in recent years and we show that the principle brain area associated with this common representation is a subregion of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex ({vmPFC})/orbitofrontal cortex ({OFC}). The data available today suggest that this common valuation path is a core system that participates in day-to-day decision making suggesting both a neurobiological foundation for standard economic theory and a tool for measuring preferences neurobiologically. Perhaps even more exciting is the possibility that our emerging understanding of the neural mechanisms for valuation and choice may provide fundamental insights into pathological choice behaviors like addiction, obesity and gambling.},

Some standard theoretical models assert that decision makers evaluate choices either by weighting those attribute optimally in light of previous experience (so-called rational models), or adopting heuristics that use attributes suboptimally but in a manner that yields reasonable performance at minimal cost (e.g., the take-the-best heuristic). However, these models ignore both the possibility that decision makers might learn to associate reward with whole stimuli (a particular combination of attributes) rather than individual attributes and the common finding that decisions can be overly influenced by recent experiences and exhibit cue competition effects. Participants completed a two-alternative choice task where each stimulus consisted of three binary attributes that were predictive of reward, albeit with different degrees of reliability. Their choices revealed that, rather than using only the "best" attribute, they made use of all attributes but in manner that reflected the classic cue competition effect known as overshadowing. The time needed to make decisions increased as the number of relevant attributes increased, suggesting that reward was associated with attributes rather than whole stimuli. Fitting a family of computational models formed by crossing attribute use (optimal vs. only the best), representation (attribute vs. whole stimuli), and recency (biased or not), revealed that models that performed better when they made use of all information, represented attributes, and incorporated recency effects and cue competition. We also discuss the need to incorporate selective attention and hypothesis-testing like processes to account for results with multiple-attribute stimuli.},

The first goal of this paper is to provide a literature review on the neural underpinnings and cognitive models of decision strategy selection and thus set the stage for a neurocognitive model of this process. The second goal is to outline such a unifying, mechanistic model that can explain the impact of noncognitive factors (e.g., affect, stress) on strategy selection. To this end, we review the evidence for the factors influencing strategy selection, the neural basis of strategy use and the cognitive models of this process. We also present the Bottom-Up Model of Strategy Selection ({BUMSS}). The model assumes that the use of the rational Weighted Additive strategy and the boundedly rational heuristic Take The Best can be explained by one unifying, neurophysiologically plausible mechanism, based on the interaction of the frontoparietal network, orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex and the brainstem nucleus locus coeruleus. According to {BUMSS}, there are three processes that form the bottom-up mechanism of decision strategy selection and lead to the final choice: (1) cue weight computation, (2) gain modulation, and (3) weighted additive evaluation of alternatives. We discuss how these processes might be implemented in the brain, and how this knowledge allows us to formulate novel predictions linking strategy use and neural signals.},

In many settings, attending to and evaluating these attributes does not help the decision maker determine which of the available alternatives is the most desirable.

Across six experiments, we find that decision makers do direct their attention selectively and ignore attributes that are not present in or associated with either of the available alternatives. However, they are as likely to attend to common attributes as they are to attend to attributes that are unique to a single alternative. These results suggest the need for novel theories of attention in preferential choice.},

A question of fundamental importance is how the current percept—what we think the probability now is—depends on the sequence of observed samples. Answers to this question are strongly constrained by the manner in which the current percept changes in response to changes in the hidden parameter. Subjects do not update their percept trial-by-trial when the hidden probability undergoes unpredictable and unsignaled step changes; instead, they update it only intermittently in a step-hold pattern. It could be that the step-hold pattern is not essential to the perception of probability and is only an artifact of step changes in the hidden parameter. However, we now report that the step-hold pattern obtains even when the parameter varies slowly and smoothly. It obtains even when the smooth variation is periodic (sinusoidal) and perceived as such. We elaborate on a previously published theory that accounts for: (i) the quantitative properties of the step-hold update pattern; (ii) subjects’ quick and accurate reporting of changes; (iii) subjects’ second thoughts about previously reported changes; (iv) subjects’ detection of higher-order structure in patterns of change.

Understanding how and why probability is distorted is a key issue in understanding the peculiar character of experience-based decision. We consider how probability information is used not just in decision-making but also in a wide variety of cognitive, perceptual, and motor tasks. Very similar patterns of distortion of probability/frequency information have been found in visual frequency estimation, frequency estimation based on memory, signal detection theory, and in the use of probability information in decision-making under risk and uncertainty. We show that distortion of probability in all cases is well captured as linear transformations of the log odds of frequency and/or probability, a model with a slope parameter, and an intercept parameter. We then consider how task and experience influence these two parameters and the resulting distortion of probability. We review how the probability distortions change in systematic ways with task and report three experiments on frequency distortion where the distortions change systematically in the same task. We found that the slope of frequency distortions decreases with the sample size, which is echoed by findings in decision from experience. We review previous models of the representation of uncertainty and find that none can account for the empirical findings.},

A classic urn-ball paradigm served as experimental strategy, involving a factorial two (prior probabilities) by two (likelihoods) design. Five computational models of cognitive processes were compared with the observed behaviour. Parameter-free Bayesian posterior probabilities and parameter-free base rate neglect provided inadequate models of probabilistic inference. The introduction of distorted subjective probabilities yielded more robust and generalizable results. A general class of (inverted) S-shaped probability weighting functions had been proposed; however, the possibility of large differences in probability distortions not only across experimental conditions, but also across individuals, seems critical for the model’s success. It also seems advantageous to consider individual differences in parameters of probability weighting as being sampled from weakly informative prior distributions of individual parameter values. Thus, the results from hierarchical Bayesian modelling converge with previous results in revealing that probability weighting parameters show considerable task dependency and individual differences. Methodologically, this work exemplifies the usefulness of hierarchical Bayesian modelling techniques for cognitive psychology. Theoretically, human probabilistic inference might be best described as the application of individualized strategic policies for Bayesian belief revision.},

Using operant conditioning, we trained mice to detect visual contrast in a two-alternative forced-choice task. After 3–4 weeks of training, mice performed hundreds of trials in each session. Numerous sessions yielded high-quality psychometric curves from which we inferred measures of contrast sensitivity. In multiple sessions, however, choices were influenced not only by contrast, but also by estimates of reward value and by irrelevant factors such as recent failures and rewards. This behavior was captured by a generalized linear model involving not only the visual responses to the current stimulus but also a bias term and history terms depending on the outcome of the previous trial. We compared the behavioral performance of the mice to predictions of a simple decoder applied to neural responses measured in primary visual cortex of awake mice during passive viewing. The decoder performed better than the animal, suggesting that mice might not use optimally the information contained in the activity of visual cortex.},

	abstract = {Numerous studies have demonstrated that animals’ tolerance for risk when foraging can be affected by changes in metabolic state. Specifically, animals on a negative energy budget increase their preferences for risk, while animals on a positive energy budget are typically risk-averse. The malleability of these preferences may be evolutionarily advantageous, and important for maximizing chances of survival during brief periods of energetic stress. However, animals adapted to living in unpredictable conditions are unlikely to benefit from risk-seeking strategies, and instead are expected to reduce energetic demands while maintaining risk-aversion. We measured risk preferences in lemurs, a group of primates restricted to the island of Madagascar. Lemurs have evolved diverse anatomical and behavioral traits for survival in a harsh and unpredictable ecology, and these traits have been explained as forms of anatomical and behavioral risk reduction. We therefore predicted that lemurs would also be risk-averse in a behavioral task that offered subjects a choice between a small certain reward, and an uncertain but potentially large reward. In Experiment 1, the average rewards associated with the constant and variable options were equal and lemurs exhibited high levels of risk-aversion, replicating a phenomenon that has been demonstrated in dozens of taxa. In Experiment 2, we gradually increased the average value of the variable option relative to the constant option. Lemurs’ preferences tracked these changes and subjects became more risk-seeking as the risk premium increased. However, many subjects maintained high levels of risk-aversion even when the average payout of the variable option yielded double that of the constant option. These results are consistent with the notion that lemur cognition has evolved to minimize risk in an unpredictable island environment.},

	abstract = {Animals are sensitive to risk or the variability of a reward distribution, and the energy budget rule of risk sensitivity theory predicts that it is adaptive for an animal to be risk averse when it is on a positive energy budget and to be risk prone when it is on a negative budget, because the utility of a potential large reward is much higher in the latter case. It has, however, been notoriously difficult to find conclusive empirical support for these predictions. We performed a comprehensive test of the energy budget rule in the honeybee, Apis mellifera, by constructing empirical utility functions and by testing the choice of bees for a constant or variable reward with an olfactory conditioning assay subsequent to manipulating their energy budgets. We demonstrate that a decline in energetic state leads to an increasing choice for a variable reward, while an increase in energetic state leads to an increased choice for a constant reward. We then show that subjects maintained on constant high or low energy budgets are risk indifferent, which suggests that an animal must perceive a change in its energetic state to be risk sensitive. We discuss the challenges of finding empirical evidence for the energy budget rule and the necessity of integrating physiological assays in these tests. Based on our previous results showing that parasitic infections cause an energetic stress in honeybees, we also discuss the possibility of energetic shortfall being responsible for the observed display of risky behaviour in infected bees.},

Such individual differences are potentially associated with differences in foraging efficiency and in fitness. Furthermore, behavioral responses may be correlated in specific suites of so-called behavioral syndromes that are consistent across different contexts and with time. Here, we present a field investigation on individual differences between wild, free-flying nectarivorous bats (Glossophaga commissarisi) in the foraging context. We further investigated how individual differences affect choice performance, and we examined their interdependence within hypothesized behavioral syndrome structures. Free-ranging bats were individually identified as they visited an array of 24 artificial flowers with nectar of high or low sugar concentration. We found that three behavioral measures of foraging behavior were individually stable over the two-month observation period. We investigated the link between individual behavioral measures and measures of choice performance using generalized linear mixed models. Individual measures of choice performance showed significant repeatability, and we found evidence that bats making more visits per bout tend to be slower in learning to avoid unprofitable flowers. We used a multi-response generalized linear mixed model to estimate between-individual correlations and compare hypothesized syndrome structures. There were no clear patterns of between-individual correlations among the behavioral measures in our study, despite the measures exhibiting significant repeatability. This may indicate that foraging behavior depends on multiple individual behavior dimensions that are not adequately described by simple models of behavioral syndromes.},

	abstract = {Laboratory experiments with starlings, Sturnus vulgaris, were conducted to investigate the interaction between timing and cost-benefit considerations. The design simulated an environment in which food was distributed in patches. Patches contained a random number of food items (N=0–4) separated by a fixed inter-capture interval or fixed interval. All patches ended with sudden depletion. The time elapsed since the last prey capture was the only way to detect the depletion of the patch. Once the patch was depleted a new patch could be reached by travelling between two perches. Three measures of timing were taken: (1) rate of working for food as function of ‘waiting’ time in a patch, (2) the time of the last response in a patch or ‘giving-in’ time, and (3) the time at which travel was initiated or ‘moving-on’ time. The fixed interval that characterized patches was varied between conditions. The mean time of the peak in working rate was consistently centred around the fixed interval, while the other two measures of timing kept a roughly linear relation to the fixed interval, with slope greater than one. In accordance with Scalar Expectancy Theory, variability in the three forms of timing was proportional to the magnitude of the fixed interval. The birds seemed to take account of this increase in variability as shown by the mean value of their giving-up criterion. These results imply that information-processing constraints are important for modelling behavioural optimality.},

Here we show that this paradox is also present in rats, and explore the underlying decision process. Subjects chose between two options that delivered food probabilistically after a fixed delay. In one option (“info”), outcomes (food/no-food) were signaled immediately after choice, whereas in the alternative (“non-info”) the outcome was uncertain until the delay lapsed. Rats sacrificed up to 20\% potential rewards by preferring the info option, but reversed preference when the cost was 60\%. This reversal contrasts with the results found with pigeons and starlings and may reflect species’ differences worth of further investigation. Results are consistent with predictions of the Sequential Choice Model ({SCM}), that proposes that choices are driven by the mechanisms that control action in sequential encounters. As expected from the {SCM}, latencies to respond in single-option trials predicted preferences in choice trials, and latencies in choice trials were the same or shorter than in single-option trials. We argue that the congruence of results in distant vertebrates probably reflects evolved adaptations to shared fundamental challenges in nature, and that the apparently paradoxical overvaluing of information is not sub-optimal as has been claimed, even though its functional significance is not yet understood.},

Other research in an operant setting has shown that rats often produce minimal errors around the reversal location, demonstrating response patterns similar to patterns exhibited by humans and primates in this task. The current study aimed to reduce, but not eliminate, the ability for rats to utilize egocentric cues by placing the response levers on the opposite wall of the chamber in relation to the pellet dispenser. Results showed that rats made minimal errors prior to the reversal, suggesting time-based cues were not controlling responses, and that they switched to the second correct stimulus within a few trials after the reversal event. Video recordings also revealed highly structured patterns of behavior by the majority of rats, which often differed depending on which response was reinforced. We interpret these findings as evidence that rats are adept at utilizing their own egocentric cues and that these cues, along with memory for the recent response-reinforcement contingencies, aid in maximizing reinforcement over the session.},

To understand how adaptive mechanisms may fail to maximize food intake, we review a model inspired by optimal foraging principles that reconciles sub-optimal choice with the view that current behavioral mechanisms were pruned by the optimizing action of natural selection. To move beyond retrospective speculation, we then review critical tests of the model, regarding both its assumptions and its (sometimes counterintuitive) predictions, all of which have been upheld. The overall contention is that (a) known mechanisms can be used to develop better ultimate accounts and that (b) to understand why mechanisms that generate suboptimal behavior evolved, we need to consider their adaptive value in the animal’s characteristic ecology.},

Principles of neuronal selection also suggest that competitive inhibition may occur in early valuation stages, before option selection. We found that behavior in multi-attribute choice is best explained by a model involving competition at multiple levels of representation. This hierarchical model also explains neural signals in human brain regions previously linked to valuation, including striatum, parietal and prefrontal cortex, where activity represents within-attribute competition, competition between attributes and option selection. This multi-layered inhibition framework challenges the assumption that option values are computed before choice.

However, reinforcement learning algorithms are notorious for not scaling well to multidimensional environments, as is required for real-world learning. We hypothesized that the brain naturally reduces the dimensionality of real-world problems to only those dimensions that are relevant to predicting reward, and conducted an experiment to assess by what algorithms and with what neural mechanisms this “representation learning” process is realized in humans. Our results suggest that a bilateral attentional control network comprising the intraparietal sulcus, precuneus, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is involved in selecting what dimensions are relevant to the task at hand, effectively updating the task representation through trial and error. In this way, cortical attention mechanisms interact with learning in the basal ganglia to solve the “curse of dimensionality” in reinforcement learning.},

	abstract = {The use of equivalence testing in scientific research is increasing beyond its traditional role in the drug approval process. Largely due to its ease of use and recommendations from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration guidance, the most common statistical method for testing equivalence is the two one-sided tests ({TOST}) procedure. Like classical point-null hypothesis testing, {TOST} is subject to multiplicity concerns as more comparisons are made. Here we give a condition that bounds the familywise error rate ({FWER}) using {TOST} and leads to a simple solution for controlling the {FWER}. Specifically, we demonstrate that if all pairwise comparisons of k independent groups are being evaluated for equivalence, then simply scaling the nominal type I error rate down by (k−1) is sufficient to maintain the {FWER} at the desired value or less. The resulting rule is much less conservative than the equally simple Bonferroni correction. An example of equivalence testing in a non-drug development setting is given.},

In the Gambling Machine Task, participants choose between options that differ in three dimensions: frequency of loss, amount of loss, and certain gain. The task was administered to 231 children and adolescents (age range=8–17years). Latent group analysis of their performance allowed precise classification of the underlying decision rules. The majority of participants used sequential decision rules, and the number of evaluated dimensions in these rules increased with age. Integrative rule use decreased with age.

	abstract = {Many animals understand numbers at a basic level for use in essential tasks such as foraging, shoaling, and resource management. However, complex arithmetic operations, such as addition and subtraction, using symbols and/or labeling have only been demonstrated in a limited number of nonhuman vertebrates. We show that honeybees, with a miniature brain, can learn to use blue and yellow as symbolic representations for addition or subtraction. In a free-flying environment, individual bees used this information to solve unfamiliar problems involving adding or subtracting one element from a group of elements. This display of numerosity requires bees to acquire long-term rules and use short-term working memory. Given that honeybees and humans are separated by over 400 million years of evolution, our findings suggest that advanced numerical cognition may be more accessible to nonhuman animals than previously suspected.
Honeybees learn to add or subtract one item from a set using color cues and can interpolate operations to a novel number.

	abstract = {The ability to estimate number is widespread throughout the animal kingdom. Based on the relative close phylogenetic relationship (and thus equivalent brain structures), non-verbal numerical representations in human and non-human primates show almost identical behavioural signatures that obey the Weber–Fechner law. However, whether numerosity discriminations of vertebrates with a very different endbrain organization show the same behavioural signatures remains unknown. Therefore, we tested the numerical discrimination performance of two carrion crows (Corvus corone) to a broad range of numerosities from 1 to 30 in a delayed match-to-sample task similar to the one used previously with primates. The crows' discrimination was based on an analogue number system and showed the Weber-fraction signature (i.e. the ‘just noticeable difference’ between numerosity pairs increased in proportion to the numerical magnitudes). The detailed analysis of the performance indicates that numerosity representations in crows are scaled on a logarithmically compressed ‘number line’. Because the same psychophysical characteristics are found in primates, these findings suggest fundamentally similar number representations between primates and birds. This study helps to resolve a classical debate in psychophysics: the mental number line seems to be logarithmic rather than linear, and not just in primates, but across vertebrates.},

	abstract = {Parental care is crucial for offspring survival in many taxa but its burden and costs are often not equally distributed between the sexes. In bats, the majority of parental care is provided by females, making examples of paternal support towards pups exceedingly rare. One exception to this general pattern seemed to be the polygynous Seba's short-tailed fruit bat Carollia perspicillata; two earlier studies suggested that paternal care occurs, i.e. that harem males prompt females to retrieve vocalizing pups. To corroborate this suggestion, we investigated the occurrence of maternal and paternal care in reaction to pup isolation calls in C. perspicillata. Acoustic measurements of 905 isolation calls from 17 pups revealed sufficient interindividual variation to encode an individual vocal signature. Correspondingly, mothers were capable of using this individual signature to discriminate between their own pups and age-matched pups from other females belonging to their colony. Maternal experience was positively correlated with the strength of response behaviour during playbacks. Thus, our results indicate that pup isolation calls were used to elicit maternal care and that mothers recognize their pups based on an individual signature in isolation calls. However, in contrast to the previous studies mentioned above, we found no evidence that harem males reacted to pup isolation calls by prompting the respective mothers to retrieve their vocalizing pups. Instead, our results demonstrate that harem males engaged in courtship activities that were unaffected by pup isolation calls.},

	abstract = {Parasitic wasps are known to improve their foraging efficiency after learning of herbivore-induced plant volatiles ({HIPVs}) upon encountering their hosts on these plants. However, due to spatial and temporal variation of herbivore communities, learned {HIPV} cues can become unreliable, no longer correctly predicting host presence. Little is known about the potential fitness costs when memories holding such unreliable information persist. Here we studied how persistent memory, containing unreliable information, affects the foraging efficiency for hosts in Cotesia glomerata. Wasps were conditioned to associate one of two types of {HIPVs} with either P. brassicae frass, 1 single oviposition in P. brassicae, 3 ovipositions in P. brassicae spaced in time or they were kept unconditioned. The following day, wasps were allowed to forage in a wind tunnel, in an environment that either conflicted or was congruent with their learned plant experience. The foraging environment consisted of host (P. brassicae) and non-host (Mamestra brassicae) infested plants. The conflicting environment had non-hosts on the conditioned plant species and hosts on the non-conditioned plant species, whereas the congruent environment had hosts on the conditioned plant species and non-hosts on the unconditioned plant species. Wasps had to navigate through five non-host infested plants to reach the host-infested plant. Since C. glomerata wasps do not distinguish between {HIPVs} induced by host and non-host caterpillars, the conflicting foraging situation caused a prediction error, by guiding wasps to non-host infested plants. Especially wasps given 3 spaced oviposition experiences, tested in a conflicting situation, spent significantly more time on non-host infested plants and showed a high tendency to oviposit in the non-hosts. As a result, they took significantly more time to find their hosts. Conditioned wasps, which were tested in a congruent situation, were more responsive than unconditioned wasps, but there was no difference in foraging efficiency between these two groups in the wasps that showed a response. We conclude that persistent memories, such as formed after 3 experiences spaced in time, can lead to maladaptive foraging behavior if the contained information becomes unreliable.},

	abstract = {Identifying the amount of prey available is an important part of an animal's foraging behaviour. The risk-sensitive foraging theory predicts that an organism's foraging decisions with regard to food rewards depending upon its satiation level. However, the precise interaction between optimal risk-tolerance and satiation level remains unclear. In this study, we examined, firstly, whether cuttlefish, with one of the most highly evolved nervous system among the invertebrates, have number sense, and secondly, whether their valuation of food reward is satiation state dependent. When food such as live shrimps is present, without training, cuttlefish turn toward the prey and initiate seizure behaviour. Using this visual attack behaviour as a measure, cuttlefish showed a preference for a larger quantity when faced with two-alternative forced choice tasks (1 versus 2, 2 versus 3, 3 versus 4 and 4 versus 5). However, cuttlefish preferred the small quantity when the choice was between one live and two dead shrimps. More importantly, when the choice was between one large live shrimp and two small live shrimps (a prey size and quantity trade-off), the cuttlefish chose the large single shrimp when they felt hunger, but chose the two smaller prey when they were satiated. These results demonstrate that cuttlefish are capable of number discrimination and that their choice of prey number depends on the quality of the prey and on their appetite state. The findings also suggest that cuttlefish integrate both internal and external information when making a foraging decision and that the cost of obtaining food is inversely correlated with their satiation level, a phenomenon similar to the observation that metabolic state alters economic decision making under risk among humans.},

Here we present data from a five-level learning and problem-solving experiment. Seven octopuses (Octopus vulgaris) were first trained to open an L shaped container to retrieve food (level 0). After learning the initial task all animals followed the same experimental protocol, first they had to retrieve this L shaped container, presented at the same orientation, through a tight fitting hole in a clear Perspex partition (level 1). This required the octopuses to perform both pull and release or push actions. After reaching criterion the animals advanced to the next stage of the test, which would be a different consistent orientation of the object (level 2) at the start of the trial, an opaque barrier (level 3) or a random orientation of the object (level 4). All octopuses were successful in reaching criterion in all levels of the task. At the onset of each new level the performance of the animals dropped, shown as an increase in working times. However, they adapted quickly so that overall working times were not significantly different between levels. Our findings indicate that octopuses show behavioral flexibility by quickly adapting to a change in a task. This can be compared to tests in other species where subjects had to conduct actions comprised of a set of motor actions that cannot be understood by a simple learning rule alone.},

In trials on a single day and across multiple days, crayfish learned to exit the maze with significantly reduced latency and with fewer turns. In addition, we examined place memory in 40-min periods with the maze closed and found that crayfish spent longer in the vicinity of a previously open exit compared to a closed exit. Probe tests were conducted using a forced-choice procedure to determine whether crayfish remembered the route out of the maze using primarily place cues or response learning. We found that approximately equal numbers of animals used each strategy, and individuals were able to switch from one strategy to the other on different test days. Males and females did not differ significantly in their performance in the place memory test, maze exit task, or probe tests. Both sexes displayed place memory for the exit location and reduced latency to exit during trials 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, and 1 week after initial training trials, suggesting that spatial memories in crayfish are relatively enduring.},

	abstract = {Serial reversal learning is considered a reliable approach for the testing of behavioral flexibility, and animals that inhabit fluctuating habitats and different environments are expected to possess behavioral and cognitive flexibility. The ocellate river stingray (Potamotrygon motoro) is one such species. Comprising the first serial reversal learning experiment among elasmobranchs, this study trained seven juvenile P. motoro in a visual two-alternative forced-choice task, in which a food-rewarded stimulus and an unrewarded alternative stimulus were presented in pseudo-random order on either side of a barrier. In the session after a stingray reached the learning criterion ({LC}), food was associated with the alternative stimulus, and this reward association continued to be switched whenever {LC} was achieved. Overall, five stingrays reversed successfully at least once. All of them required more sessions (mean = 67.8 sessions) for the first reversal than they needed during training (mean = 22 sessions). One stingray demonstrated progressive improvement across four reversal phases, thus showing that Potamotrygon motoro can inhibit a previously learned association faster with experience, probably as it develops strategies for rule identification. One individual became slower to reach the ({LC}) across three reversal phases, which may indicate a dominant influence of proactive interference. Another stingray demonstrated large fluctuations across three reversals. The fourth individual completed two reversals and required approximately the same number of sessions for each. One stingray had just completed one reversal by the end of this study. Since stingrays took longer than a related species to reverse learning, future studies could look at the effects of changing stimulus type or training regime on the performance of P. motoro.},

To explain the human results, Prospect Theory postulates a convex utility for losses and concave utility for gains. In contrast, Scalar Utility Theory ({SUT}) explains the animal data by postulating that the cognitive representation of outcomes follows Weber's Law, namely that the spread of the distribution of expected outcomes is proportional to its mean. {SUT} also would explain human results if utility (even if it is linear on expected outcome) followed Weber's Law. We present an experiment that simulates losses and gains in a bird, the European Starling, to test the implication of {SUT} that risk proneness/aversion should extend to any aversive/desirable dimension other than time and amount of reward. Losses and gains were simulated by offering choices of fixed vs. variable outcomes with lower or higher outcomes than what the birds expected. The subjects were significantly more risk prone for losses than for gains but, against expectations, they were not significantly risk averse toward gains. The results are thus, in part, consistent with Prospect Theory and {SUT} and show that risk attitude in humans and birds may obey a common fundamental principle.},

	abstract = {Individual choices are not made in isolation but are embedded in a series of past experiences, decisions, and outcomes. The effects of past experiences on choices, often called sequential biases, are ubiquitous in perceptual and value-based decision-making, but their neural substrates are unclear. We trained rats to choose between cued guaranteed and probabilistic rewards in a task in which outcomes on each trial were independent. Behavioral variability often reflected sequential effects, including increased willingness to take risks following risky wins, and spatial ‘win-stay/lose-shift’ biases. Recordings from lateral orbitofrontal cortex ({lOFC}) revealed encoding of reward history and receipt, and optogenetic inhibition of {lOFC} eliminated rats’ increased preference for risk following risky wins, but spared other sequential effects. Our data show that different sequential biases are neurally dissociable, and the {lOFC}’s role in adaptive behavior promotes learning of more abstract biases (here, biases for the risky option), but not spatial ones.},

	abstract = {In 1979, Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky published a ground-breaking paper titled “Prospect Theory: An Analysis of Decision under Risk,” which presented a behavioral economic theory that accounted for the ways in which humans deviate from economists’ normative workhorse model, Expected Utility Theory [1, 2]. For example, people exhibit probability distortion (they overweight low probabilities), loss aversion (losses loom larger than gains), and reference dependence (outcomes are evaluated as gains or losses relative to an internal reference point). We found that rats exhibited many of these same biases, using a task in which rats chose between guaranteed and probabilistic rewards. However, prospect theory assumes stable preferences in the absence of learning, an assumption at odds with alternative frameworks such as animal learning theory and reinforcement learning [3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. Rats also exhibited trial history effects, consistent with ongoing learning. A reinforcement learning model in which state-action values were updated by the subjective value of outcomes according to prospect theory reproduced rats’ nonlinear utility and probability weighting functions and also captured trial-by-trial learning dynamics.},
